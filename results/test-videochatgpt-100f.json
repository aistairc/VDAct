Using a dry sponge to wipe a table without first clearing the items on it can lead to the transfer of dirt, grime, and food particles from the table to the sponge, which can then be transferred back onto the table when the sponge is used to clean other surfaces. This can result in a less clean and potentially unhygienic table.\n\nA more effective approach would be to first clear the table of all items, including foodstuff, seasonings, and drinks, before wiping it with a dry sponge. This will ensure that the table is cleaned thoroughly and that the cleaning process does not introduce any additional contaminants to the surface. Additionally, using a damp cloth or sponge with a cleaning solution can help remove stubborn stains and dirt more effectively, further enhancing the cleanliness of the table."
