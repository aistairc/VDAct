A person is in the living room where they interact with a box on a wall shelf. After grabbing the box, they sit on a sofa, fall, and then walk to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they open and close a fridge, walk to a dish bowl, and transfer it to the kitchen table. They grab cereal and milk, pouring both into the dish bowl. The person then moves to the bedroom, retrieves a book from a bookshelf, reads it, grabs a paper from a desk, and writes on the paper while seated in a chair.
