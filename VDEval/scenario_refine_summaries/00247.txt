A person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he interacts with a dish bowl, kitchen table, cereal, milk, and alcohol. He pours cereal and milk into the dish bowl and switches off the light before returning to the living room. In the kitchen, he also pours alcohol into a water glass and drinks from it. He then grabs a cupcake and goes back to the living room, where he approaches a TV stand and a wall shelf before falling.
