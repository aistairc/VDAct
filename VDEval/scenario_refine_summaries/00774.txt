A person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he finds a potato on the kitchen table. He grabs the potato, then goes to the sink, switches on the faucet, soaks the potato, and switches off the faucet. Next, he goes to the microwave, opens it, puts in the potato, closes it, and switches it on, then off. He grabs a salad from the kitchen table, puts both the potato and salad in the garbage can, then grabs milk and a cupcake from the kitchen. The person returns to the living room, walks to the TV, turns it on, grabs the remote control, and goes back to the kitchen to get juice. He returns to the living room, sits on the sofa, drinks the juice, and puts the remote control on the TV stand before switching off the TV.
