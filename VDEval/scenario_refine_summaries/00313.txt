The person is in the living room, then walks to the bedroom and the kitchen. He finds a potato on the kitchen table and rug, grabs it, and soaks it in the sink after turning on the faucet. He uses the microwave, putting the potato inside, turns it on and off, and then retrieves a cutlery knife from the kitchen. He walks back and forth between the kitchen, bedroom, and living room multiple times, eventually sitting on the sofa and interacting with the TV and remote control. He grabs alcohol from the kitchen, takes it to the living room, drinks it, and puts the remote on the coffee table before turning off the TV.
