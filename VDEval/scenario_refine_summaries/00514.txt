The person is in the living room, where he grabs a cellphone next to him, sits on a sofa facing the TV, and texts. He then walks to the kitchen, grabs milk and a water glass from the kitchen table, drinks the milk, and grabs a cupcake. The person returns to the living room, turns to a garbage can, and falls. After walking back to the kitchen to check the fridge, he returns to the living room, falls again, then walks to a box in the bookshelf, grabs the box, and sits back on the sofa, falling once more.
