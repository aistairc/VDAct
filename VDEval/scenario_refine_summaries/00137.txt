The person is in the kitchen where he interacts with various items: the wine on the kitchen table, the plate on the kitchen counter, and the washing sponge also on the counter. He grabs the wine, places it on the table, then grabs the plate and puts it in the sink. He then uses the washing sponge at the sink and at the fridge, which he opens and wipes with the sponge before closing it. After completing his tasks in the kitchen, he walks to the bedroom, where he grabs a pillow from the bed, sits on the bed, stands up, and then falls.
