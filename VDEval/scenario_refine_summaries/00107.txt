A person is in the kitchen, near the sink and kitchen counter. He grabs a washing sponge, wipes with it at the sink, then uses the faucet. He picks up a plate and a water glass from the kitchen counter and kitchen table, respectively, and places them on the kitchen table. He also takes a cutlery knife and fork from the kitchen counter and places them on the kitchen table along with a wineglass and wine. After completing tasks in the kitchen, he goes to the living room, turns on the TV, then sits on the sofa. He stands and switches off the TV before returning to the kitchen, where he opens and closes the fridge, then walks back to the living room and falls.
