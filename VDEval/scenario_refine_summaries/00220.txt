The person is in the living room, where the TV, TV stand, sofa, and a desk are located. He turns on the TV, grabs the remote control, and then goes to the kitchen to get a slice of bread from the toaster. After eating the bread in the living room, he interacts with the TV again before sitting on the sofa. He then walks to a chair, reads a book from the desk, and writes on paper. Afterward, he grabs a box from the bookshelf before returning to the sofa, where he falls while sitting.
