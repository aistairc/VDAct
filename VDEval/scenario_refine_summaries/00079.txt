The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, retrieves a book from the desk, and reads it. He also grabs a piece of paper and writes on it. Then, he returns to the kitchen, where he interacts with a potato, soaks it in water, and places it in a frying pan after adding milk. He then goes back to the living room, turns on the TV, and interacts with a coffee table and remote control. After falling, he goes back to the kitchen to grab a slice of bread, places it in the frying pan, and adds more milk, before switching off the stove.
