A person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he grabs a potato from the table. He soaks the potato in the sink after turning on the faucet. Next, he takes a frying pan from the stove, places the potato in it, and then grabs milk from the table to pour into the frying pan. He briefly turns on and off the stove. 

After returning to the living room, he climbs onto the coffee table. Later, he goes back to the kitchen, grabs the milk again, and returns to the frying pan, pouring more milk. He then grabs a slice of bread from the toaster and puts it in the frying pan. 

He switches the stove on and off again. The person then opens the fridge to get juice, which he places on the kitchen table before grabbing the milk from the fridge again and closing it.
