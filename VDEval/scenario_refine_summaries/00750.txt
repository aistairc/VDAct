A person moves from the kitchen to the bedroom, sits on a chair, and falls. They then walk back to the kitchen, grab milk from the kitchen table, and pour it into a water glass. The person drinks both the water and milk, then reorganizes the water glasses. Afterward, they walk to the living room, interact with a sofa and a pillow, and ultimately stand and fall again.
