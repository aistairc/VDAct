The person is initially in the bedroom, then walks to the kitchen where he interacts with juice and a water glass on the kitchen table, pouring juice into the water glass and drinking from it. He retrieves crackers from the kitchen counter, puts them into the fridge, and switches off the light before going to the living room. In the living room, he grabs his cellphone and returns to the bedroom, sits on the bed, and texts on the cellphone. He then moves back to the kitchen and the living room, sitting on the sofa and continuing to text.
