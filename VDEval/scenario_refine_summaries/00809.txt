A person is in the kitchen, near the kitchen table and a bookshelf. After walking to the kitchen table, he grabs a water glass and moves to the sink to pour it. He then takes a wineglass from the table and walks to the living room. In the living room, he interacts with a sofa and a TV, switching the TV on using a remote control he grabs nearby. He then returns to the kitchen to get milk, brings it back to the living room, sits on the sofa, and drinks the milk. Finally, he puts the remote control on the TV stand and turns off the TV.
