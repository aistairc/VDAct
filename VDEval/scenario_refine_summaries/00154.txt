A person is in the kitchen and interacts with items like wine, a kitchen table, a washing sponge, and a fridge. After cleaning the fridge with the sponge, he moves to the living room to read a book and write on paper. He then turns on the TV, grabs the remote, and returns to the kitchen to get milk, which he drinks on the sofa. After switching off the TV, he returns to the kitchen to grab a carrot, soaks it in the sink, and places it in a frying pan on the stove, turning the stove on and off afterward.
