The person is in the bedroom and walks to the kitchen, where he finds juice, a water glass, milk, a cupcake, a potato, a light switch, a clock, and a TV. He interacts with the juice and water glass, pouring juice into the glass and drinking both. After switching off the light, he moves to the living room, where he uses the computer and sits in a chair. He then returns to the kitchen to grab milk and a cupcake before going back to the living room. After some house activities, he returns to the kitchen to obtain a potato, soaks it in the sink, and places it in a microwave, which he then closes and turns on before switching it off.
