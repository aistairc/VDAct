The person is in the living room, where he grabs his cellphone and sits on the sofa to text. He then goes to the kitchen, gets milk from the kitchen counter, and drinks it. Afterward, he walks to the bedroom, retrieves a book from the bookshelf, reads it at the desk, and also grabs some paper. He writes on the paper, then puts it down and operates the computer while sitting on a chair. Finally, he stands, turns off the computer, walks back to the living room, and sits on the sofa again.
