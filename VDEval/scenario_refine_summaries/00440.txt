The person is in the living room and then moves to the kitchen, where he finds a potato next to him on the kitchen table. He grabs the potato and walks to the sink, turning on the faucet to soak the potato before turning it off. He then goes to the frying pan on the stove, puts the potato in it, and pours milk from the kitchen table into the frying pan. After switching on the stove and subsequently turning it off, he retrieves a wineglass from the kitchen table, pours wine into two glasses, and places them down. He then gets a cutlery knife from the kitchen counter, puts it on the kitchen table, and walks back to the living room. There, he switches on the TV, grabs the remote control, sits on the sofa, stands, and finally turns off the TV.
