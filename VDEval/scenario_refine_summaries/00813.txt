The person moves through different rooms: the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. In the bathroom, he retrieves a toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter and uses the faucet to wet the toothbrush. After switching off the faucet, he goes back to the bedroom, where he turns off the light switch, sits on the bed, and interacts with a pillow. He then moves to the kitchen, followed by the living room, where he approaches a sofa facing the TV. He grabs a pillow from the sofa, sits down, stands up, and falls.
