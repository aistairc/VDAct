The person is in the bedroom, where he grabs a pile of clothes from the closet and folds them onto the bed. He then goes to the kitchen, grabs juice and a water glass from the kitchen table, and drinks from the water glass. Next, he grabs alcohol from the kitchen table, goes to the bathroom to grab a towel, and returns to the kitchen to scrub with the alcohol before placing the towel on the kitchen table. He then opens the fridge, puts the alcohol inside, and closes it. This process is repeated as he finds and grabs alcohol and wine from the fridge, placing the alcohol on the kitchen table before closing the fridge again.
