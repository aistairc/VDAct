The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, then to the bedroom, where he sits on the bed. He then goes to the bathroom, interacts with the towel, and uses the toilet before returning to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds juice and a water glass, drinks from both, and soaks the water glass at the faucet. He grabs a carrot, soaks it, and uses the frying pan before turning on and off the stove. He then goes back to the living room, where he interacts with the sofa and a pillow, eventually sitting on the sofa before falling.
