The person is in the living room where he grabs a cellphone from a wall shelf. He sits on a sofa facing a TV and a computer, then texts on the cellphone before walking to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he grabs and drinks milk, then walks to a TV and the bathroom where he grabs a towel. He returns to the kitchen to wipe something with the towel, walks to the kitchen table, turns to a microwave, falls, then walks to grab wine from the table. He goes back to the living room and bathroom multiple times for the towel before using the wine to scrub something. He puts the towel on the kitchen table, walks to the fridge, opens it, puts the wine inside, closes the fridge, and switches off the light switch before returning to the living room.
