The person is in the kitchen, next to the kitchen table and washing sponge, which he uses before grabbing a frying pan and chicken. He then walks to the sink, turns to the bench, and falls. The person moves to the living room, where he interacts with a book and sits on the sofa to read. He switches on the TV, grabs the remote control, and returns to the kitchen to get a slice of bread from the toaster. After eating the bread, he goes back to the living room, sits on the sofa, and then places the remote on the TV stand before switching off the TV.
