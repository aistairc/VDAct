The person starts in the bathroom and then moves to the bedroom and kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds a light switch, turns it ON, and notices the fridge and washing sponge. He cleans the fridge with the sponge before moving to the stove to wipe it down as well. After that, he goes to the living room, where he retrieves a book from a bookshelf and reads it. He then grabs a paper from the desk, sits in a chair, writes on the paper, and puts it back on the desk. Next, he turns on the computer, types on the keyboard, and later switches off the computer. Finally, he sits on the sofa in the living room.
