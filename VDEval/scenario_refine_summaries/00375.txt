The person is in the living room, where the paper is on the desk. He walks to the paper, grabs it, and then walks to the desk. He also moves to the chair next to him, sits down, and writes on the paper. After standing, he returns to the desk and puts down the paper, then walks to the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, where he uses the toilet and grabs a toothbrush. He turns on the faucet, soaks and rinses the toothbrush, switches the faucet off, and then returns to the bedroom after a trip to the kitchen where he drinks milk and water from glasses. Finally, he sits on the bed.
