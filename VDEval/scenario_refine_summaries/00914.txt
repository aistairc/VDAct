The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he finds a carrot on the kitchen table and grabs it. He switches on the faucet to soak the carrot and then switches it off. He interacts with a frying pan on the stove, putting the carrot there and briefly turning the stove on and off. Afterward, he retrieves a plate from the kitchen counter and places it on the kitchen table before returning to the living room. There, he grabs a book and paper from the desk, sits on a chair, and writes on the paper. He goes back to the kitchen to grab a slice of bread from the toaster, places it on the frying pan, and pours milk from the kitchen table into the pan.
