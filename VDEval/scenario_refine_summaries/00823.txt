The person is in the living room, then walks to the bedroom and kitchen multiple times. In the kitchen, he interacts with the fridge, which he opens and closes. He grabs cereal and milk from the kitchen counter and uses the frying pan on the stove, which he turns on and off. The person then goes back to the bedroom, sits on a chair, and falls. He retrieves slippers from the floor and puts them in the closet. Finally, he walks to the bathroom, switches on the light, and the light is now ON.
