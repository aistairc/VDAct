The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where he interacts with alcohol, a water glass, and cutlery (knife and fork). After pouring and drinking, he returns to the living room, switches on the TV, retrieves the remote control, and falls onto the sofa. He then grabs a book from the bookshelf, reads it at the desk, and eventually walks to the bathroom, where he sits on the toilet.
