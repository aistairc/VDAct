The person is in the kitchen and walks to the bedroom, where he grabs a book next to him. He reads the book, then walks to the desk and places the book there. He sits in a chair facing the computer, types on the keyboard, and then turns off the computer. He moves to the sofa and sits down before returning to the kitchen. He grabs milk from the kitchen table, pours it into a water glass, and drinks from it multiple times. He also interacts with a plate, ultimately placing it in the sink.
