A person is in the kitchen where a water glass is on the kitchen table and rug. They walk to the glass and pour water at the sink. Afterward, they move to the bedroom to grab pants and a shirt from the closet. They place these items on the bed and then pick up a pile of clothes, folding and storing them in the closet. The person then goes to the living room, turns on the light switch, and grabs two books from the bookshelf. Finally, they turn to the cabinet and fall.
