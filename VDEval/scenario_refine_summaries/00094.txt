A person moves between the kitchen, bedroom, and living room. In the living room, there is a sofa facing a TV on a coffee table. The person sits on the sofa and later walks to the kitchen, where he interacts with a potato on the kitchen table, soaks it in the sink, and uses a frying pan on the stove. He then grabs milk, pours it into the frying pan, and turns on the stove. The person also handles a chicken on the cutting board, walks to the sink, and interacts with a fridge before falling. He moves back to the kitchen table, encounters the potato and salad, and ultimately places both the potato and salad on a garbage can.
