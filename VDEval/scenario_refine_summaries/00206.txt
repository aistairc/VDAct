The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen. He interacts with the fridge, opening and closing it, then heads back to the living room. After falling, he returns to the kitchen to get a potato from the kitchen table, then soaks it in the sink. He proceeds to use the microwave, putting the potato inside and turning it on before heading back to the living room. There, he sits on the sofa, watches TV, retrieves the remote control, and eventually drinks juice after going back to the kitchen for it. He then returns to the living room to sit on the sofa again, puts the remote control on the TV stand, and switches off the TV. Later, he goes back to the kitchen to get a carrot, soaks it in the sink, and interacts with a frying pan on the stove, where he places the carrot and switches the stove on and off.
