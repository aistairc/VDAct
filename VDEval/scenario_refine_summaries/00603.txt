The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he interacts with a dish bowl on a bookshelf. He grabs the dish bowl, then moves to a kitchen table, places the dish bowl there, and subsequently retrieves cereal and milk from the kitchen. After combining them, he goes to the bathroom to get a toothbrush and toothpaste, uses them, and turns on/off the faucet. The person then returns to the bedroom, where he turns on a light switch, grabs pants from the closet, folds them, and places them on the bed. Finally, he moves back to the living room to observe a wall picture frame facing the TV.
