The person is in the kitchen, where the fridge and TV are located. The fridge is initially closed, but he opens it, wipes it, and then closes it again. He also retrieves a washing sponge, a cutlery fork, and cereal, putting the cereal in the fridge. After that, he walks to the living room, grabs a towel from the bathroom, and returns to the kitchen to wipe with the towel. He then collects milk and a cupcake, both found in the kitchen, before heading back to the living room where he approaches a TV stand and a chair, after which he falls.
