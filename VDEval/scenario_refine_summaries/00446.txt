The person is in the living room where the TV is located. The TV is off, and he walks over to switch it on using a remote control that's also in the living room. After turning on the TV, he goes to the kitchen to grab milk from the kitchen table. He then returns to the living room, sits on the sofa, drinks the milk, and puts the remote control on the TV stand before switching the TV off again. Next, he goes back to the kitchen, picks up a dish bowl, and places it on the kitchen table. He grabs cereal, pours it into the dish bowl, then takes the milk again to pour over the cereal. After that, he picks up a wineglass from the kitchen table and sets it down. He continues by grabbing a washing sponge from the counter, walks over to the fridge, opens it, wipes it with the sponge, and then closes the fridge.
