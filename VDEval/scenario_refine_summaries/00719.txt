The person is in the kitchen and engages with various items including a potato, salad, garbage can, and cutlery fork. The potato is on the kitchen table and rug, while the salad is also on the kitchen table and rug, with both facing the TV. The person grabs both the potato and the salad, then interacts with the garbage can by placing the potato and salad on top of it. After leaving for the living room, the person turns on the TV, grabs the remote control, and later falls onto a sofa. They return to the kitchen to interact with a cutlery fork and fridge, eventually retrieving a carrot from inside the fridge before closing it again.
