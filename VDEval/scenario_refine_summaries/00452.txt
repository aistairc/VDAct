The person goes from the bathroom to the living room, kitchen, and bedroom, where he turns on the light switch. He finds a book on the wall shelf, grabs it, sits on the bed, and reads. Then, he returns to the kitchen, living room, and bathroom, where he closes the door and turns on the bathroom light. He repeats his movements to the bedroom, turns off the light switch, sits on the bed again, and goes back to the bathroom, where he sits on the toilet and then stands before squatting three times.
