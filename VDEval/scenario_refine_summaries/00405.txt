The person is in the living room, where he approaches and turns on the computer next to him. He sits in a chair facing the computer, types on the keyboard, and then stands up. He walks to the kitchen, then to the bedroom, and arrives in the bathroom. He grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste from the bathroom counter. After squeezing the toothpaste onto the toothbrush, he turns on the faucet to soak the toothbrush, then turns it off. The person is in the bathroom before he returns to the bedroom, then the kitchen, and finally the living room, where he straddles three times.
