A person is in the living room, where they walk to and use a computer. They then walk to the kitchen, where they interact with wine, a plate, cutlery, and a water glass, putting items in the fridge and on the sink. The person also grabs a towel from the bathroom and wipes down surfaces in the kitchen. Afterward, they return to the living room, turn on the TV, retrieve the remote control, sit on the sofa, and then switch off the TV.
