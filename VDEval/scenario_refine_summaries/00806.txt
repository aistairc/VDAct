The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where the fridge and TV are located. He opens and closes the fridge before returning to the living room, where he falls and interacts with a desk. He then goes to the bathroom to grab a towel, returns to the living room, and uses the towel on a mouse and keyboard on the desk. He picks up a pillow and wipes with the towel before moving back to the kitchen, where he grabs milk and a frying pan, pours the milk, and turns on the stove. He later gets a slice of bread from the toaster, puts it on the frying pan, pours more milk, and switches off the stove.
