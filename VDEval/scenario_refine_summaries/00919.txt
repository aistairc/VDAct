The person is in the kitchen, where he interacts with the stove, washing sponge, and kitchen table. He walks to the stove, grabs the washing sponge from the counter, uses it, and then moves to the living room. In the living room, he reads a book, grabs paper from the desk, writes on it while sitting in a chair, and then returns to the kitchen. There, he grabs a potato from the table, soaks it at the sink, and places it on a frying pan. He then grabs milk, pours it into the frying pan, and switches the stove on and off. Eventually, he wipes the kitchen table with the sponge and retrieves a cutlery knife, placing it on the kitchen table.
