The person is in the bathroom, then walks to the bedroom and kitchen. He finds milk on the kitchen counter, grabs it, drinks it, and puts it back down. He then grabs a water glass, soaks it at the faucet, drinks from it, and puts it down. After moving to the living room and back to the kitchen, he interacts with wine and a wineglass, pouring and drinking from them. He then grabs a plate and places it in the sink, before returning to the wineglass and putting it on the kitchen table.
