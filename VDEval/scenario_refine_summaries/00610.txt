A person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, where they grab milk from the table and also take a water glass, pouring milk into it and drinking both water and milk. Afterward, they return to the bedroom, sit on a chair, and fall. The person then walks to the bathroom, where they grab a toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter, brush their teeth using water from the faucet, and then turn off the faucet.
