The person is in the bedroom, where he finds notes in the bookshelf. He retrieves the notes and goes to the desk, then to a chair on the rug, where he sits and writes. After standing, he places the notes on the desk and moves to the kitchen and bathroom. In the bathroom, he uses the toilet before returning to the bedroom, where he turns on the light switch. He picks up a book from the bookshelf and sits on the bed to read it. He then returns to the kitchen, grabs milk from the kitchen table, and also gets a water glass. He pours the milk into the glass, drinks from it, and then drinks the milk directly. He picks up a cutlery knife from the kitchen table, places it in the sink, and then grabs a bottle of wine, putting it down on the kitchen table.
