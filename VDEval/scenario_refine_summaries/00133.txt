A person is in the bathroom, where they walk to the toilet and then to the bar soap on the counter. After grabbing the soap, they turn on the faucet, wet the soap several times, and then turn off the faucet. They walk to the sink, grab a towel, and wipe their hands. The person then grabs a toothbrush from the counter, uses it, and places it back at the sink. Next, they take a water glass to use, then put it back at the sink. They continue by grabbing toothpaste, applying it, and putting it down on the sink. Finally, they grab face cream, use it, and once again wipe their hands with the towel.
