A person moves through a house, starting in the living room and going to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he interacts with a dish bowl, a TV, a clock, a kitchen table, cereal, and milk. He pours cereal and milk into the dish bowl, then grabs alcohol and uses it on himself. The person then moves to the bathroom to grab a towel and returns to the kitchen. He places the towel on the kitchen table and on the rug. The person opens and puts alcohol into the fridge before going to the bedroom and sitting on a chair. He falls from the chair, gets up, and interacts with a desk in the bedroom. He returns to the bathroom for the towel again and wipes with it in the bedroom.
