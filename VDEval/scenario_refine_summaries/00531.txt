A person is in the bathroom, walking to the toilet and then to the bar soap on the counter. After soaking and rinsing the soap, he switches off the faucet. He then moves to the living room, where he turns on the TV and grabs the remote control. The person goes back and forth between the kitchen and the living room, grabbing juice and sitting on the sofa to drink it. Afterward, he puts the remote on the coffee table and switches off the TV before returning to the bathroom, where he grabs a towel. Finally, he wipes with the towel in the living room.
