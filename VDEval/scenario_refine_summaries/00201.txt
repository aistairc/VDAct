A person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where they interact with a book, desk, paper, computer, keyboard, and chair. After reading and writing, they switch on and off the computer before sitting on the sofa. They then return to the kitchen, grab a potato from the table, and soak it at the sink. The person picks up a frying pan, places the potato inside, and then grabs milk from the table to pour into the frying pan. They switch the stove on and off during the process.
