The person is in the kitchen and walks to the bedroom, where he sits on a chair and falls. He then returns to the kitchen, where he interacts with the kitchen table and fridge. The fridge is closed, but he opens it to find alcohol and wine inside. He grabs the alcohol, puts it on the kitchen table, and then grabs the wine before closing the fridge.
