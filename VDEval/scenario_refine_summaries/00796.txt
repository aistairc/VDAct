The person is in the kitchen and walks to the closed fridge, which is next to him, and opens it to find and grab alcohol and wine, placing them on the kitchen table. He then goes to the living room, grabs a book next to the TV, and reads it at the desk where he also finds paper. After using the chair at the desk and typing on the computer, he switches the computer off. He sits on the sofa, then interacts with the bookshelf to grab another book before falling. Finally, he walks back to the kitchen and falls again.
