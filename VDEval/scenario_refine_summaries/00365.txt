A person is in the kitchen where they interact with various items. They grab a potato and a salad from the kitchen table, then put both on the garbage can. The person then grabs a plate from the kitchen counter and puts it in the fridge along with a cupcake. After closing the fridge, the person moves to the living room, sits on the sofa, and later returns to the kitchen. They take a dish bowl, place it on the kitchen table, and then grab cereal and milk to pour into the bowl. The person also grabs a frying pan and chicken from the kitchen. As they turn towards the bench, they fall.
