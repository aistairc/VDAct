A person moves from the kitchen to the living room, retrieves a book from the bookshelf, and sits on the sofa to read it. Afterward, he returns to the kitchen, grabs wine and a wineglass from the kitchen table, pours the wine, and eats a cupcake. He then goes to the bathroom but quickly returns to the living room and then to the kitchen. There, he retrieves a carrot, soaks it in the sink, and then interacts with a frying pan on the stove, putting the carrot on it and switching the stove on and off.
