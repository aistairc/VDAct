The person is in the bathroom. He moves around the house, going from the bedroom to the kitchen, living room, and then to the bathroom, where he interacts with the toilet, bar soap, toothbrush, and toothpaste. He uses the faucet to soak and rinse the bar soap and toothbrush multiple times, switching it on and off as needed. The toothbrush and toothpaste are on the bathroom counter, and he grabs and uses them during his time in the bathroom.
