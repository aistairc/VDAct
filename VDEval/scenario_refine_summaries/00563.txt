The person is in the living room, next to a computer. He switches on the computer, sits on a chair facing it, and types on the keyboard. After standing, he switches off the computer and walks to the kitchen, where he interacts with a slice of bread in a toaster and eats it. He notices chicken and salmon on a microwave and puts both into a garbage can. He then wipes the fridge with a washing sponge, opens it, and closes it after cleaning. The person leaves the kitchen for the living room, turns on a TV, grabs a remote control, turns off the TV, and places the remote on a coffee table. He then goes to the bathroom before returning to the bedroom, where he turns on the light switch.
