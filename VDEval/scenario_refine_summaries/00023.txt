A person is in their living room where they use a computer and sit on a chair. They type on the keyboard, then walk to the kitchen and bedroom. In the bedroom, they interact with a closet to grab pants and a shirt, placing them on the bed, and then move a pile of clothes. After folding the clothes, they put everything back in the closet. The person then turns off a light switch in the bathroom before returning to the bedroom. Finally, they go to the kitchen, where they move between the kitchen table and fridge.
