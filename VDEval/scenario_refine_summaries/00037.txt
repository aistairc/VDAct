A person is in the kitchen where they interact with several items. They grab crackers from a wall shelf, then put them in a closed fridge before closing it again. They then grab a potato from the kitchen table and salad from the kitchen counter, putting both on a garbage can. After spending time in the living room and bedroom, they return to the kitchen to grab juice from the table. They place the juice on the kitchen table and also grab a water glass. The person pours juice into the water glass, drinks from it several times, and then drinks the juice.
