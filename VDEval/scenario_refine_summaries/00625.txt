A person is in the living room where the TV is located. The TV is off, and the person switches it on using a remote control before walking to the kitchen. In the kitchen, the person grabs a slice of bread from the toaster and eats it while sitting on the sofa in the living room. After standing up, they turn off the TV and return to the kitchen, where they get a potato from the kitchen table. The person soaks the potato in a sink before placing it in a microwave to cook. After using the microwave, the person moves to the fridge, wipes it with a sponge, and finally places crackers inside the fridge before closing it.
