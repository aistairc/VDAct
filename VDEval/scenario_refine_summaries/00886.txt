A person moves throughout various rooms, starting in the kitchen where they find a wineglass on the kitchen table. After grabbing the wineglass, they walk to the bedroom to access a book on the bookshelf and subsequently move to read and write on paper at a desk. The person then activates a light switch in the bathroom before running through the living room, where they interact with a sofa and grab a pillow. They also pick up a towel in the bathroom and use it to scrub before shaking and putting down the pillow.
