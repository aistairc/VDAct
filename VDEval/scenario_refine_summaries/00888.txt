The person is in the kitchen, then walks to the living room where he interacts with the TV, switching it on and off. He grabs the remote control, sits on the sofa, drinks juice, and then stands up. He returns to the kitchen, opens and closes the fridge, and falls. He then walks to the bedroom where he sits on the bed, interacts with a cat, and returns to the living room to sit on the sofa again.
