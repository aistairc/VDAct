A person is in the kitchen where various items are located: a plate, cutlery fork, milk, cupcake, cereal, frying pan, alcohol, and wine. The plate is on the kitchen table, as is the cutlery fork and milk, while the cupcake is also on the kitchen table but is later taken to the living room. The person interacts with these items, grabbing them and placing some on a rug. They walk to the stove, which is turned on and off, and open the fridge to find and take the alcohol and wine. Throughout this, the person remains inside the kitchen and interacts with the items on the kitchen table and the rug.
