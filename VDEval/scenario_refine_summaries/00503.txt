The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he interacts with a potato, a sink, and a microwave, ultimately soaking and microwaving the potato. He then grabs milk and a cupcake from the kitchen before returning to the living room. In the living room, he turns on the TV, grabs the remote, and then returns to the kitchen to get a slice of bread from the toaster. After returning to the living room, he eats the bread, puts the remote on the TV stand, and switches off the TV. The person then goes back to the kitchen to open and close the fridge before returning to the living room and falling.
