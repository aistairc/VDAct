The person is in the kitchen, where he interacts with a frying pan on the stove and grabs it. He then walks to the kitchen counter to get a chicken and moves to the sink to use a washing sponge from the counter. After turning on and off the faucet, he goes to the fridge, opens it, wipes it with the sponge, and puts the chicken inside before closing it. He wipes the kitchen counter and stove with the sponge, then walks to the kitchen table facing the TV, wipes it as well, and returns to the sink to place the sponge down. Finally, he grabs a towel from the TV stand, walks to the TV, and wipes it.
