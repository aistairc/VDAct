The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where he finds a carrot on the kitchen table. He grabs the carrot, then walks to the sink to turn on the faucet, soaking the carrot before switching it off. Next, he approaches the frying pan on the stove, where he places the carrot. After turning the stove on and off, he moves to the bedroom, sits on a chair, and falls. He then switches on the computer, types on the keyboard, and walks back to the kitchen, then to the living room, where he finds a book and a piece of paper on a desk. After reading and writing, he sits on a chair and then on the sofa. Finally, he stands and walks toward the TV before falling again.
