A person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he grabs milk and a frying pan. He then pours the milk and switches on the stove. After that, he retrieves a slice of bread from the toaster and places it on the frying pan. He also acquires a cutlery knife and puts it on the kitchen table. He wipes the stove with a washing sponge and later heads back to the living room, where he turns on the TV and retrieves the remote control. After falling while turning to the sofa, he stands, walks back to the kitchen to get wine, and brings it to the living room. He drinks the wine while sitting on the sofa, then returns to the TV stand to put down the remote and switches off the TV.
