The person moves between the bedroom, kitchen, living room, and bathroom. He turns the bathroom light switch OFF, then returns to the living room, where he interacts with a wall picture frame and a cellphone on a wall shelf. He moves back to the bedroom to sit on the bed and texts on the cellphone. Next, he again heads to the living room, sits on a sofa facing a computer and TV, and continues to text. He stands up, walks to the TV, and later switches it ON. He grabs the remote control from the TV stand, sits back on the sofa, and eventually switches the TV OFF again.
