The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, retrieves a book and paper from the desk, and sits in a chair to write. He then grabs a cellphone from a coffee table and texts before going to the bedroom, where he sits on the bed and texts again. Returning to the kitchen, he picks up a potato, soaks it at the sink, and places it in the microwave. After operating the microwave, he grabs chocolate syrup from the kitchen table, puts it in the fridge, and then goes back to the bedroom, where he interacts with a pillow on the bed.
