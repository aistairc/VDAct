The person is in the kitchen and walks to the light switch to turn it off before moving to the living room. In the living room, he interacts with a bookshelf, grabs a book, and sits on a chair facing a computer. After typing on the keyboard, he stands and returns to the kitchen to grab a cutlery knife, which he places in the sink before going back to the living room. There, he reads the book, grabs a paper, and writes on it while sitting in the chair. He switches on the computer, types again, then switches it off. Finally, he walks to the sofa and sits down.
