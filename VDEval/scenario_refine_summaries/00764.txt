The person is in the kitchen where he walks to the juice on the kitchen table, grabs it, and pours it into a water glass. He drinks from the water glass multiple times, then puts it down. Next, he grabs a plate next to the sink, puts the plate in the sink, and grabs a wineglass from the kitchen table, placing it there as well. He opens the closed fridge, finds and grabs a carrot and a potato, and puts the carrot on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
