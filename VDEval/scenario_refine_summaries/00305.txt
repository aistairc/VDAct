A person is in the kitchen, where they interact with cereal and a wineglass, moving between the kitchen counter, fridge, sink, and kitchen table. After pouring wine into the glasses, they turn off the light and walk to the living room, where they sit on the sofa and then stand up. They later walk to the TV and return to the kitchen, where they fall.
