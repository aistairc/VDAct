A person moves from the bedroom to the bathroom, where they interact with a towel and toilet. They then return to the bedroom, switch on the light, and engage with a bed and pillow. After that, they go to the kitchen, grab a washing sponge, and wipe something. They pick up milk and a cupcake from the kitchen table, then move to the living room, where they approach a coffee table facing a computer and TV. Finally, they turn to the curtains and fall.
