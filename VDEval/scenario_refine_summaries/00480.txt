The person moves between the living room and the kitchen, interacting with various items. He first goes to the kitchen, grabs salmon, and soaks it in the sink before putting it on a frying pan, which is placed on the stove. After switching the stove on and off, he returns to the living room, where he turns on the TV and retrieves a remote control. He briefly interacts with the sofa before falling and getting back up. The person then goes back to the kitchen to grab milk from the kitchen table and pours it into the frying pan. He also takes a slice of bread from the toaster, places it in the frying pan, pours more milk, and finally switches off the stove.
