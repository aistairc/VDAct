A person is in the living room, then walks to the kitchen where he finds a potato on the kitchen table. He soaks the potato at the sink, then puts it in the microwave before switching it on and off. He grabs a water glass and places it on the kitchen table, then interacts with the TV. After going to the bathroom to grab a towel, he returns to the kitchen and wipes with it. He then grabs a wineglass, pours wine, and places it on the sink. Next, he opens the fridge, retrieves a carrot, and places it on the kitchen table before grabbing the potato again and closing the fridge.
