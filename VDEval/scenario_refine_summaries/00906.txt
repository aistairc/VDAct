The person is in the living room before walking to the kitchen. He finds a carrot on the kitchen table, grabs it, and soaks it under a faucet that he turns on. After soaking the carrot, he switches off the faucet and moves to a frying pan on the stove, placing the carrot on the stove. He switches the stove on and then off. Next, he walks to crackers, grabs them, and puts them in the fridge, which he opens and then closes. The person continues by grabbing a plate and placing it on the kitchen table. He then retrieves a washing sponge, wipes the stove, and finally returns to the sink to put the plate down.
