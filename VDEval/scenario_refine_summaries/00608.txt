The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where he finds a potato on the kitchen table. He grabs the potato and then walks to the sink, where he turns on the faucet, soaks the potato, and turns the faucet off. He then moves to the frying pan on the stove, puts the potato in it, and also grabs milk from the kitchen counter to pour into the frying pan. After switching the stove on and off, the person walks to the bedroom. There, he retrieves a book from the bookshelf, goes to the desk to read it, then grabs paper and writes on it while sitting in a chair facing the computer. After putting the paper back on the desk and typing on the keyboard, he switches off the computer and walks back to the living room. Finally, he sits on the sofa.
