A person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where a carrot is on the kitchen table. The person grabs the carrot and then walks to the sink, turns on the faucet, and soaks the carrot before turning the faucet off. The person then walks to the frying pan on the stove, places the carrot on the stove, turns it on and off, and grabs a water glass from the kitchen table. After putting the water glass back on the table, the person walks to the washing sponge on the kitchen counter, grabs it, and wipes the stove. 

Next, the person goes to the bedroom and sits on a chair but falls. The person returns to the kitchen, grabs the water glass from the table, switches on the faucet, walks to the sink to put the water glass down, switches off the faucet, and then drinks from the water glass. Finally, the person walks to the kitchen counter and places the water glass there.
