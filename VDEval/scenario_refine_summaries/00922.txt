A person is in the bedroom with a cat on the bed. He grabs the cat, sits on the bed, then walks to the kitchen, grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, and moves to the frying pan on the stove. He pours milk into the pan, turns on the stove, then switches it off after use. The person then goes to the living room, switches on the TV, grabs the remote from the TV stand, and later turns off the TV. He returns to the kitchen, takes the slice of bread from the toaster, goes back to the living room, and eats the bread before putting the remote back and turning off the TV again.
