A person is in the kitchen, where a chicken and a salmon are on the counter. The person grabs both, puts them on a garbage can, and then walks to the bedroom, interacting with a bed and a pillow. The person returns to the kitchen, grabs a water glass from the table, switches on the faucet, fills the glass, drinks, and puts it back on the counter. The person then pours water into two additional glasses. They walk to the fridge, open it, find juice and milk, grab both, and place the juice on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
