The person is in the bedroom, then walks to the bathroom where he sits on the toilet. After that, he goes to the sink, grabs a towel from the bathroom counter, and wipes with it. He also grabs a toothbrush and scrubs with it, then puts it down. The person then takes a water glass and uses it, followed by grabbing toothpaste, applying it, and placing it on the sink. He grabs face cream, uses it, and puts it down as well. The person wipes with the towel again, then returns to the toothbrush, grabs it, and turns on the faucet to rinse the toothbrush before switching it off and putting the toothbrush down.
