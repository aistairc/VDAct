The person is in the living room, next to a computer. He walks to the computer, switches it on, sits on a chair facing the computer, and types on the keyboard. After standing and switching off the computer, he walks to the kitchen. 

In the kitchen, he interacts with a slice of bread inside a toaster, grabs it, and eats it. He then approaches a frying pan on the stove and grabs it, before walking to a chicken on a cutting board near the microwave. After grabbing the chicken, he walks to the sink and turns towards the fridge, but falls. 

Next, he walks to a water glass on the kitchen table, grabs it, and pours water into two glasses, placing them in the sink. He then goes to the living room to grab paper on the desk, sits back down, writes on the paper, and puts it back on the desk. 

He subsequently walks to the bathroom, sits on the toilet, and then goes to the bedroom where he switches on the light.
