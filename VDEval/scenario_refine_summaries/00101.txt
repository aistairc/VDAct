The person is in the bedroom, where he walks to the pants in the closet, grabs them, and then moves to the bed on the floor, folding the pants and placing them on the bed. He then goes to the living room, where he interacts with a wall picture frame, a desk, and picks up a mouse and a keyboard. He wipes with a towel and switches on the TV before walking to the kitchen, grabbing alcohol from the kitchen table. Returning to the living room, he sits on the sofa, drinks the alcohol, stands up, and places the remote control on the coffee table before switching off the TV.
