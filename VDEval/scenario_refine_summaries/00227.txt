A person is in the kitchen where he grabs wine from the kitchen table, then a plate from the counter. He places the plate on the table, then grabs chicken and salmon from the counter and places them in the garbage can. The person then moves to the fridge, opens it, and wipes it with a washing sponge before closing it. Finally, he walks to the living room, sits on the sofa, and remains there.
