The person is in the living room, where the TV and TV stand are located. He walks through various rooms, including the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, grabbing a towel from the bathroom and returning to the living room. In the kitchen, he collects a slice of bread and a frying pan, pours milk from the kitchen table into the frying pan while the stove is on, and then grabs chicken from the counter.
