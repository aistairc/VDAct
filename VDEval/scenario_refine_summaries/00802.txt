The person is in the living room where the TV and TV stand are located. The TV is turned off, and he switches it on using the remote control, which he retrieves before heading to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds a slice of bread in the toaster, grabs it, and returns to the living room to eat it on the sofa. After eating, he switches off the TV and goes back to the kitchen. He then gets salmon from the kitchen counter, soaks it in water from the faucet, and places it in a frying pan on the stove, which he turns on briefly. Next, he opens the fridge to find and grab a carrot, placing it on the kitchen table, and then he finds and grabs a potato before closing the fridge.
