A person is in the kitchen, where he walks to the milk on the counter, grabs it, and places it on the kitchen table. He also finds and drinks from a water glass. The person then picks up a chicken and a salmon from the kitchen counter and places them into the garbage can. He grabs a washing sponge from the counter, wipes the fridge, and then wipes the sink using the sponge. The faucet is off, but he turns it on and then off again before finally wiping the sink one last time.
