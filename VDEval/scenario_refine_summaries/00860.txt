A person is in the living room where a box is on a wall shelf. He walks to the box, grabs it, and then sits on a sofa, falling in the process. He then goes to the kitchen, where he finds salmon on the kitchen counter. After grabbing the salmon, he walks to a sink, switches on the faucet to soak the salmon, and then turns it off. He next walks to a frying pan on the stove, puts the salmon in the pan, turns on the stove, then turns it off. In the kitchen, he also picks up cutlery knives from the kitchen table and places them there. He then approaches the fridge, which is next to him, and opens it after retrieving a washing sponge from the kitchen counter. He wipes the fridge with the sponge and then closes it.
