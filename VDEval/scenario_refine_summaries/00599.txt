The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he opens and closes the fridge, then returns to the living room and falls. He turns on the TV and grabs the remote control. He later walks back to the kitchen to get wine, which he brings to the living room and drinks while sitting on the sofa. After that, he retrieves his cellphone from a wall shelf and goes to the bedroom to text before returning to the living room to sit on the sofa again and text some more. He then goes back to the kitchen, where he grabs a potato from the kitchen table, soaks it in the sink, and places it on a frying pan. After getting milk from the kitchen table, he pours it into the frying pan and turns the stove on and off.
