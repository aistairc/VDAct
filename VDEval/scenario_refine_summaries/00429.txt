The person is in the bedroom and interacts with the computer, turning it on and typing. He then moves to the kitchen, where he grabs a salmon, soaks it under the faucet, and places it in a frying pan on the stove. After preparing it, he walks to the kitchen table, where he grabs a water glass, pours water, and adds a plate. He then collects cutlery (a knife and fork), wine, and a wineglass, placing them all on the kitchen table.
