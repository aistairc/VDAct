The person moves from the bathroom to the bedroom, switches off the light, and sits on the bed. He then goes to the kitchen, looks at a wall picture frame, and grabs some alcohol from the kitchen table. He returns to the bathroom to get a towel, then goes back to the kitchen to scrub with the alcohol. He walks to the fridge, opens it, puts the alcohol inside, and closes it. He grabs a wineglass from the kitchen table, pours two glasses at the sink, and uses a washing sponge to clean. He operates the faucet and continues to wipe with the sponge.
