The person is in the kitchen and walks to the living room where he finds a book on a desk. He grabs the book, reads it, and then walks to paper next to him on the desk. He sits in a chair and writes on the paper. He then returns to the kitchen, grabs a potato from the kitchen table, soaks it at the sink, and places it in a frying pan on the stove. He pours milk onto the potato, switches the stove on and off again, then retrieves wine, a plate, and a carrot from the kitchen. He places the wine and carrot on the kitchen table and puts the plate there as well. Finally, he returns to the fridge to grab another potato before closing it.
