A person is in the kitchen where they find wine on the kitchen table, grab it, and wipe the table with a washing sponge. They then move to the living room, grab a book from a wall shelf, sit on a sofa, and read. The person walks to the TV, turns it on, and then grabs a remote control from the TV stand. Afterwards, they return to the kitchen to get a cupcake, go back to the living room, sit on the sofa again, and eat the cupcake. Finally, they place the remote control back on the TV stand and switch off the TV.
