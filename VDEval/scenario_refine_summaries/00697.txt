The person is in the living room, where a box is on a wall shelf. He walks to the box, grabs it, then goes to the sofa, sits down, and falls. He then moves to the kitchen, grabs a salmon from the kitchen counter, soaks it at the sink, and places it on a frying pan on the stove after turning it on and off. The person walks to the kitchen table to grab a plate, puts it in the sink, then retrieves a wineglass from the table and pours wine into two glasses before placing them down. Next, he walks to the bedroom, where he finds a book on the bookshelf and grabs it. He goes to the desk, reads the book, then grabs a paper and puts the book down on the desk. Finally, he sits on a chair and writes on the paper.
