A person moves through various rooms in a house, starting in the kitchen and walking to the bedroom. In the bedroom, he interacts with a chair, falls while sitting on it, and navigates to a closet containing a shirt. He retrieves the shirt, then goes to the bed, shakes and folds the shirt, placing it on the bed. After that, he goes to the bathroom, where he grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste, uses them at the faucet, and switches it on and off. Returning to the bedroom, he sits on the bed, falls, then goes back to the bathroom to turn on the light switch before returning to the bedroom.
