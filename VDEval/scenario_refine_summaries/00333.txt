The person is in the bathroom and walks to the bedroom, where he sits on the bed and then stands up. He switches off the light switch and sits back on the bed, later falling while sitting. Inside the bedroom, there is a pile of clothes in the closet, which he grabs, shakes, folds, and places on the bed. The person then walks to the kitchen, where he interacts with a wall picture frame and looks at it. He then opens the fridge, finds alcohol inside, grabs it, and puts it on the kitchen table. He also finds wine in the fridge, grabs it, and then closes the fridge.
