A person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where he interacts with a sofa and a TV. After sitting on the sofa, he goes back to the kitchen to get wine, which he pours into a wineglass on the kitchen table. The person then drinks from the wineglass and returns to the living room to grab a book and read it on the sofa. He also switches on the TV, grabs the remote control, and later goes back to the kitchen for alcohol. He brings the alcohol to the living room, drinks it on the sofa, and finally puts the remote control back and turns off the TV.
