The person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, passing through the living room where a wall picture frame is located. In the kitchen, he interacts with a salmon on the counter, soaking it in the sink before placing it in a frying pan on the stove. After turning on and off the stove, he cleans with a sponge at the kitchen table. He then returns to the bedroom, retrieves a book from a bookshelf, reads it, and interacts with paper on a desk. He sits in a chair, writing on the paper, then switches on a computer and types on the keyboard before standing and walking back to the kitchen.
