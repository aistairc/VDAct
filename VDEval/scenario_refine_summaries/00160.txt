The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where he interacts with the coffee table, computer, TV, and bookshelf. He grabs a book from the bookshelf, then returns to the kitchen to grab a potato, soak it, and place it in a frying pan. He also grabs milk from the kitchen table and pours it into the frying pan before turning the stove on and off. Finally, he goes to the bedroom, picks up a pillow, sits and stands on the bed, and then falls.
