The person is in the living room, sitting on a sofa that is on a rug and facing a TV on a TV stand. They walk to the kitchen, where they fall and find a wineglass next to the TV stand and a clock. The person pours wine into the glass, leaves it on the sink, and then walks to the bathroom to grab a towel. After returning to the kitchen, they wipe themselves with the towel, walk to the fridge, and open it to find juice and milk. They grab both drinks, put the juice on the kitchen table, and finally close the fridge.
