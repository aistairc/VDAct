A person is in the bedroom and walks to the kitchen, where they find juice on the kitchen table. They grab the juice, then pick up a water glass from the table, pour juice into it, and drink from it. Next, they grab cereal and put it in the fridge before leaving the kitchen for the living room. There, they interact with a TV, turning it on using a remote control they find on the TV stand. The person then returns to the kitchen to grab a cupcake, goes back to the living room, and eats it while sitting on the sofa. Finally, they turn off the TV.
