The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he interacts with a potato, soaking it at the sink and placing it in the microwave. He turns the microwave on and off, then grabs a wineglass and pours wine into it at the sink. After that, he switches off the kitchen light and returns to the living room, where he picks up a book from the bookshelf and reads it. He then moves to the bathroom to use the toilet before heading to the bedroom, where he switches on the light, retrieves another book from the bookshelf, and reads it while sitting on the bed.
