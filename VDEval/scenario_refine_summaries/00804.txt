A person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where he interacts with a sofa, rug, TV, and computer. He sits on the sofa, walks around, and eventually sits again. He later goes back to the kitchen to grab a plate and milk, returning to the living room to drink the milk while sitting on the sofa. He then finds the remote control, puts it on the coffee table, and turns the TV on and off as he moves around the room. Finally, he places the remote control back on the TV stand before switching off the TV again.
