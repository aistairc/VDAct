The person is in the bedroom and walks to the bathroom, where he sits on the toilet and then stands. He grabs bar soap from the bathroom counter, soaks it, rinses it, and turns off the faucet. He then picks up a toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter, applies the toothpaste, brushes his teeth, and rinses the toothbrush before turning off the faucet again. Afterward, he leaves the bathroom and returns to the bedroom, where he sits on the bed, stands, walks to the light switch to turn it off, and then sits on the bed again, falling while doing so.
