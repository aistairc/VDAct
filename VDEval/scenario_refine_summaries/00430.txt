A person is in the kitchen where they interact with various items. The cutlery knife is on the kitchen counter, and the person walks to it and grabs it, then places it on the sink. They also find and grab a washing sponge, using it after turning the faucet on and off. The person then interacts with a wineglass on the kitchen table, pouring wine into two glasses. Next, they open the fridge, grab a carrot and a potato, and place both on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
