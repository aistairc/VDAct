The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he interacts with items like milk, a frying pan, and a toaster. He pours milk, switches on and off the stove, grabs a slice of bread, and uses a washing sponge to wipe the kitchen table. Afterward, he pours water from a glass into the sink. The person then returns to the living room, takes a book and paper from the desk, and sits on a chair to write. He later sits on the sofa but stands up and walks to the chair before returning to the kitchen, where he falls.
