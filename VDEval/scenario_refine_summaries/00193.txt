A person is in the kitchen. He walks to the sink, which is next to him, and grabs a washing sponge from the kitchen counter. He wipes at the sink, then turns on and off the faucet. He grabs a water glass from the kitchen table, puts it down, then grabs a cutlery fork from the table and places it in the sink. He then moves to the kitchen counter to grab a chicken and a salmon, placing both on the garbage can. Afterward, he goes to the bathroom, grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste from the bathroom counter, squeezes the toothpaste, soaks the toothbrush, and switches the faucet on and off.
