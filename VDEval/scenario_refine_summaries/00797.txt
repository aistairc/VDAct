A person is in the kitchen, near a kitchen table on the floor. He walks to the table and interacts with a plate, grabbing it and placing it in the sink. Afterward, he moves to the living room, where he picks up a book and sits on the sofa to read it. He then returns to the kitchen to grab a dish bowl and puts it on the kitchen table. He takes cereal from the table, pours it into the dish bowl, and then does the same with milk. Finally, he grabs a water glass from the table, pours it in the sink, and places the glass down.
