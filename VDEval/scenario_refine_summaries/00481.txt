A person moves through areas of a house including the living room, kitchen, and bedroom. In the living room, they interact with a bookshelf, a book, a chair, a TV, a remote control, and a sofa. They walk to the kitchen to open and close the fridge, and later grab some wine from the kitchen table. Afterward, they sit on the sofa in the living room to drink the wine. They also manage the TV and remote control before taking their cellphone from the bookshelf. The person then walks to the bedroom, sits on the bed, and sends a text on the cellphone. Finally, they return to the living room to sit on the sofa and continue texting.
