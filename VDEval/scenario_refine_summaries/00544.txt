The person is in the kitchen where he grabs a water glass from the kitchen table and pours it into the sink before moving to the bedroom, where he sits on a chair and falls. He then walks to the bathroom, grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste, brushes his teeth, and uses the faucet to rinse. After that, he walks back to the bedroom, turns off the light switch, and returns to the bathroom to sit on the toilet before standing up.
