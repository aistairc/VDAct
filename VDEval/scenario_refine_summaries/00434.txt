The person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, where he interacts with a wall picture frame and a light switch. After switching off the light, he goes to the living room, interacts with a cat, and sits on a sofa facing a TV. He uses a remote control to turn on the TV and then falls back. The person gets the remote control and returns to the kitchen for alcohol, which he brings back to the living room and drinks while sitting on the sofa. He puts the remote on the coffee table and turns off the TV before moving to the computer, where he sits in a chair and types on the keyboard before standing up and heading back to the kitchen.
