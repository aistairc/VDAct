The person is in the kitchen and walks to the living room. He finds a book on a desk in the living room and grabs it, then sits on a chair facing a computer to read. He walks back to the kitchen, grabs milk from the kitchen table, pours it into a frying pan, and switches on the stove. He then grabs a slice of bread from the toaster and puts it in the frying pan, pours more milk, and switches off the stove. Next, he grabs a water glass from the kitchen table, places it there, and then takes a cutlery fork from the kitchen counter to put it in the sink. He opens the fridge, grabs juice from inside, places it on the kitchen table, retrieves the milk again, and closes the fridge.
