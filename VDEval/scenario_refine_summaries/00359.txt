A person is in the kitchen, where a water glass is on the kitchen table, next to them. They grab the glass, then walk to the bedroom. In the bedroom, they interact with the bed, pillow, and a pile of clothes, which they also grab, shake, fold, and place on the bed. They then get slippers from the floor and walk back to the kitchen, living room, and bathroom, where they turn on and off the faucet and handle a towel. After scrubbing with the towel, they return to the bedroom, put the slippers in the closet, grab a shirt from the closet, and place it on the bed.
