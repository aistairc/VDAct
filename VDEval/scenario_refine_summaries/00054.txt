A person is inside the kitchen where they walk to the kitchen table, fall, and then grab wine from the table. They put the wine into a fridge, walk to a plate on the table, then to a sink where they place the plate. They grab a fork and knife from the table, put both in the sink, and then pick up a water glass and wineglass from the table, placing them in the sink as well. The person then goes to the bathroom to grab a towel and returns to the kitchen to wipe surfaces. They continue to interact with items in the kitchen, including walking to and wiping the stove with a washing sponge. They revisit the kitchen table to put the wine down and then head to the bedroom, where they sit on a chair and fall while doing so.
