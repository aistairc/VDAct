The person starts in the living room and goes to the kitchen, where he finds alcohol on a bookshelf. He grabs the alcohol and places it on the kitchen table, next to a water glass. He drinks from the water glass before moving to grab and drink the alcohol. The person then interacts with chicken and salmon on the kitchen counter, placing them in the garbage can. He also takes a plate from the counter, places it in the sink, and then opens the fridge to wipe it with a sponge. After wiping, he switches off the light and walks back to the living room.
