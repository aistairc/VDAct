The person walks from the bedroom to the bathroom, where he finds a toothbrush and toothpaste on the bathroom counter. He grabs both, squeezes the toothpaste onto the toothbrush, and brushes his teeth. He then uses the faucet to rinse the toothbrush before switching it off. After putting the toothbrush down, he leaves the bathroom, then walks to the bedroom, kitchen, and living room, where he stretches three times.
