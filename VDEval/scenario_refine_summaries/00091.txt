The person is in the kitchen, where he finds wine on the kitchen table and grabs it. He then walks to the living room, sits on the sofa, and turns on the TV. After opening and closing the fridge, he returns to the living room, grabs the remote control, and then goes back to the kitchen to get a slice of bread from the toaster. He eats the bread, returns to the sofa, and puts the remote control on the TV stand before switching off the TV. The person then approaches the bookshelf, grabs a book, and finally falls next to a chair in the living room.
