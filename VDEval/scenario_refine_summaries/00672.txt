A person is in the living room next to a desk. He walks to the bathroom to grab a towel, then returns to the living room to grab a mouse on the desk. He wipes with the towel, then grabs a keyboard next to him. He also grabs a pillow from the sofa, wipes with the towel again, and shakes the pillow. He then walks to the TV and wipes it with the towel. After that, he moves to the kitchen where he grabs alcohol from the kitchen table. He also picks up a water glass, pours alcohol into it, drinks from the water glass, and repeats the process, finishing by drinking the alcohol.
