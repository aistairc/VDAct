The person moves from the kitchen to the bedroom, walks to a chair, sits on it, and falls. He then goes back to the kitchen, where he interacts with the kitchen table, fridge, cutlery fork, and sink, ultimately putting the cutlery fork on the sink. The person grabs a washing sponge, cleans the fridge, and then leaves for the living room. In the living room, he turns on the TV using the remote control, sits on the sofa, stands up, and turns off the TV.
