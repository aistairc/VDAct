The person is in the bedroom and walks to the kitchen, where he finds a water glass on the kitchen table. He grabs the glass, turns on the sink faucet, and puts the water glass on the sink before drinking from it and placing it back on the kitchen table. He then switches off the light and moves to the living room, where he interacts with the sofa and the TV. After falling, he returns to the kitchen to grab a cutlery fork, puts it on the sink, and then goes back to the living room and the bathroom. He picks up a towel from the bathroom counter, returns to the kitchen, and wipes with the towel.
