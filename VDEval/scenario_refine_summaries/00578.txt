A person is in the kitchen, then moves to the living room to grab a paper from a desk. He sits on a chair, writes on the paper, then returns to the desk to put down the paper. He then walks to the bathroom, sits on the toilet, and after that, returns to the bedroom and kitchen. In the kitchen, he grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, eats it, and then opens the fridge to find alcohol. He puts the alcohol on the kitchen table, which is on a rug, and then retrieves wine from the fridge before closing it.
