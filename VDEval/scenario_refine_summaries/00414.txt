The person is in the kitchen, where they interact with a wineglass, kitchen table, milk, water glass, slice of bread, frying pan, and a cutlery knife. They grab the wineglass and place it on the kitchen table, then move it to the rug. After going to the living room to switch on and off the TV and grabbing the remote control, they return to the kitchen, drink the milk and water, and soak the water glass at the faucet. They retrieve a slice of bread from the toaster, place it on the frying pan, and turn on the stove before pouring milk into the frying pan. Finally, they grab a cutlery knife and put it in the sink.
