The person moves between the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room. In the kitchen, he grabs and eats a slice of bread, then retrieves milk and a cupcake. He walks to the living room, where he interacts with a coffee table, falls, and returns to the kitchen. He proceeds to grab cereal and a frying pan and pours them together. After switching the stove on and off, he grabs a wineglass and pours wine into it. He then grabs a potato and a salad, walking to the garbage can to dispose of both.
