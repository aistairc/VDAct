A person moves from the bathroom to the bedroom, where he turns off the light switch. He then walks to the kitchen, grabs a water glass from the table, turns on the faucet, fills the glass, and drinks from it. He puts the empty glass on the kitchen counter. Next, he picks up wine from the kitchen table, walks back to the bedroom and bathroom, grabs a towel, and returns to the kitchen. He scrubs using the wine, places the towel on the kitchen table, and then goes to the fridge to store the wine before closing it. Lastly, he grabs a washing sponge, wipes the sink, and then picks up a wineglass, placing it on the kitchen table where it faces the TV.
