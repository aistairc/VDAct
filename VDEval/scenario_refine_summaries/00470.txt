A person is in the kitchen and walks to the bedroom, where he goes to the closet and grabs pants and a shirt. He moves to the bed, places the pants and shirt on it, and also grabs a pile of clothes from the closet. After folding the clothes, he puts the pants and shirt back in the closet and places the pile of clothes there as well. The person then walks to the bathroom, turns off the light, and returns to the bedroom. He shakes and folds the shirt before placing it on the bed. He goes back to the bathroom, closes the door, and sits on the toilet, ultimately standing and falling.
