The person is in the kitchen, then walks to the bedroom and living room. He locates a book on a desk in the living room, picks it up, and then sits on a sofa to read. He then goes back to the kitchen, where he finds a carrot on the kitchen counter, soaks it in the sink, and places it on a frying pan. After switching the stove on and off, he grabs a wineglass, pours wine into two glasses, and then finds a carrot and a potato inside the fridge. He puts the carrot on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
