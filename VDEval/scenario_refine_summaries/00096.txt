A person is in the living room, then walks to the kitchen where there is a slice of bread in a toaster. He grabs the slice, uses a frying pan, and pours milk into it after turning on the stove. Afterward, he moves to the bedroom, sits on a chair, falls, and then grabs a pile of clothes from the closet, putting them on the bed. The person returns to the kitchen, switches on the light in the living room, then grabs a dish bowl and cereal from the kitchen, pouring them together with milk into the dish bowl.
