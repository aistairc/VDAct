The person moves through the bathroom, living room, kitchen, and bedroom, where he turns on a light switch and retrieves a book from a wall shelf. He sits on the bed to read before moving back to the kitchen, where he interacts with a glass of water and juice on the kitchen table. After grabbing and pouring the juice into the glass, he drinks it while facing the TV. He then approaches the fridge, opens it, and uses a washing sponge to wipe it before closing it again.
