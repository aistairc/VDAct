He eats the bread, grabs milk from the kitchen table, and takes a cupcake from the kitchen as well. He then walks to the living room, approaches a coffee table, and turns to the curtains before falling. He switches off the light in the living room, returns to the kitchen, goes back to the bedroom, and finally to the bathroom, where he switches the light on.
