A person is in the bathroom where they grab a toothbrush, switch on and off the faucet, and rinse the toothbrush. They then walk to the kitchen, grab a cupcake from the table, and eat it while sitting on the sofa in the living room. After that, they return to the kitchen, grab a potato, soak it, put it in the microwave, and switch it on and off. They then walk to the frying pan, grab the chicken, and turn towards the kitchen table, but fall. The person goes back to the living room, turns on the TV, grabs the remote control, sits on the sofa, stands, and switches off the TV.
