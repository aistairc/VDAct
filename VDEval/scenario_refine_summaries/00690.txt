The person is in the bedroom and walks to the kitchen, where he finds the kitchen table on a rug on the floor. He moves next to the kitchen table, then to the fridge, before returning to the kitchen table. After that, he moves to the door, turns towards it, and falls. He then walks to the living room, where he finds a TV that is OFF on a TV stand. He switches the TV ON, grabs the remote control, and sits on the sofa. After standing up, he switches the TV OFF again. He repeats this process, turning the TV ON and OFF, before walking back to the kitchen to grab juice from the kitchen table. He returns to the living room, sits on the sofa, drinks the juice, and later ensures the remote control is placed back on the TV stand before switching the TV OFF for the final time.
