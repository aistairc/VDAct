A person is in the kitchen, where he interacts with various objects. He walks to the sink, grabs a washing sponge from the kitchen counter, and wipes the sink. He switches the faucet on and off before moving to the fridge, which he opens, wipes, and then closes after putting in a chicken. The person wipes the kitchen counter, stove, and kitchen table with the washing sponge. He places the sponge back on the sink and then grabs a towel from the TV stand. After wiping the TV, he returns to the stove, where he wipes again with the washing sponge.
