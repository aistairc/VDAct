A person is in the kitchen, which contains a kitchen table, cutlery fork, wine, potato, salad, garbage can, and fridge. The cutlery fork is on the kitchen table, next to the person, who grabs it and places it on the table. The wine is also next to him; he grabs it and puts it on the table. The potato is on the kitchen table as well, and he grabs it. The salad is on the kitchen counter, which is inside the kitchen; he grabs the salad. The person then walks to the garbage can and puts both the potato and salad on it. Next, he approaches the fridge, which is closed, opens it, finds and grabs a carrot from inside, and places it on the kitchen table. He returns to the fridge to find and grab another potato before closing it.
