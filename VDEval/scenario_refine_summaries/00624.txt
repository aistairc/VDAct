The person is in the living room and walks to the kitchen, where he finds the stove, which is off. He retrieves cereal and milk from the kitchen counter and table, pours them, and then switches the stove on and off. After returning to the living room, he grabs a book and paper from the desk and sits on a chair to write. 

He returns to the kitchen, grabs a potato from the table, soaks it in the sink, and then places it in the microwave, which he turns on and off. He then goes to the fridge, finds and grabs a carrot, and places it on the kitchen table before returning to grab the potato again and closing the fridge.
