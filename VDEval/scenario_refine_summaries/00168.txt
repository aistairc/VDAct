The person moves through the house, starting in the bedroom, then going to the kitchen and living room. In the living room, he looks at a picture frame facing the TV. Back in the kitchen, he interacts with a slice of bread in a toaster, grabs a frying pan, and switches on the stove to prepare the bread. He also grabs milk and a cupcake before returning to the living room, where he encounters a coffee table. After a fall, he goes back to the kitchen to get salmon, washes it, and prepares it in the frying pan. He then returns to the bedroom, sits on a chair, and falls again.
