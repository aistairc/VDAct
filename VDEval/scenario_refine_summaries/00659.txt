A person is in the living room, where the TV and coffee table are located. The TV is OFF, and the person switches it ON using a remote control. They leave the living room to grab juice in the kitchen, then return to the living room to drink it while sitting on the sofa. They then take their cellphone from the coffee table, go to the bedroom to text, and return to the living room to sit on the sofa again. The person then walks back to the kitchen, grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, puts it on a frying pan, and turns on the stove. After pouring milk into the pan, they switch off the stove and walk to the kitchen table but fall while turning towards the kitchen counter.
