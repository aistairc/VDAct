The person is in the kitchen and moves to the living room where the TV is on a stand. He switches on the TV, then grabs the remote control and sits on the sofa. After standing, he switches off the TV and returns to the kitchen. There, he grabs a potato from the table, soaks it in the sink, and puts it in a frying pan after pouring milk into it. He then turns on the stove, switches it off, and cleans the fridge with a sponge before closing it. He goes back to the living room, sits on the sofa while holding a pillow, then stands and falls.
