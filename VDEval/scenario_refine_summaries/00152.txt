A person moves between the kitchen and living room, sitting on a sofa in the living room before returning to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he interacts with various items, including grabbing a carrot, a plate, a water glass, cutlery (knife and fork), a wineglass, and wine. He places these items on the kitchen table, also switching the faucet and stove on and off during his actions. Ultimately, he organizes the items on the kitchen table while continuing to grab and place various objects.
