The person is in the kitchen and moves around to interact with various items. He first grabs juice from the kitchen table, then a water glass, which he uses to pour and drink juice. He also picks up a cutlery fork and later a frying pan, before grabbing chicken from the counter. After a fall, he continues to use the fork and interacts with the fridge, opening it to find juice and milk, which he also grabs.
