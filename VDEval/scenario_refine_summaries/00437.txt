A person is in the kitchen, where they encounter a potato and a salad. They grab both items and place them on a garbage can before moving to the living room. In the living room, they interact with a TV and a computer, typing on the keyboard before returning to the kitchen for a slice of bread, which they eat. The person then goes back to the living room, switches on the TV, grabs the remote control, sits on the sofa, stands again, and finally switches off the TV.
