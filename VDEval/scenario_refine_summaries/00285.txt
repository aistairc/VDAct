A person moves through various rooms, starting in the bathroom and traveling to the bedroom and kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds and grabs a cupcake and later goes to the living room where he eats it while sitting on the sofa. He interacts with a box on the bookshelf and falls off a coffee table. The person then moves back to the kitchen, where he finds a potato, soaks it in the sink, and puts it in a microwave. After heating the potato, he goes to the fridge, where he finds and grabs a carrot, placing it on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
