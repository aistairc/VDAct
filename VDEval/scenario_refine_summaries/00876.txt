The person is in the bedroom, where he walks to the bed, grabs, throws, shakes, and puts the pillow, then goes to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds a slice of bread in the toaster, grabs it, and eats it before returning to the bedroom. He again interacts with the pillow and then sits on the bed before standing and falling.
