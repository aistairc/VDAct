The person is in the kitchen. He interacts with a cutlery knife on the kitchen table, which is facing a TV also located in the kitchen. After grabbing the knife, he walks to the sink to put it down. He then grabs a plate from the kitchen table, which is facing both the clock and the TV, and places it in the sink. Next, he walks to the living room, where he interacts with a sofa, TV, and computer, eventually typing on the keyboard at the desk. After standing and switching off the computer, he returns to the kitchen. He grabs and eats a slice of bread from the toaster. He then opens the fridge to find and grab some juice, placing it on the kitchen table next to the TV. Finally, he finds and grabs milk from the fridge before closing it.
