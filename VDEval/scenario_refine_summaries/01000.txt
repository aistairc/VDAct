The person is in the living room and approaches a bookshelf located on the floor. He grabs two books from the bookshelf before moving to the kitchen, where he finds salmon on the microwave. He grabs the salmon, soaks it in the sink, and places it on a frying pan on the stove. After switching the stove on and off, he walks to a washing sponge on the kitchen counter, grabs it, and wipes the stove. He then moves to the bedroom, approaches a pillow on the bed, grabs it, sits down on the bed, stands up, and falls.
