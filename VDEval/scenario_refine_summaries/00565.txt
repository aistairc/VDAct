The person starts in the living room and walks to the kitchen. He finds a carrot on the kitchen table, grabs it, and soaks it in the sink after turning on the faucet. He then puts the carrot on the stove, switches the stove on and off, and grabs a cutlery fork from the kitchen counter, placing it in the sink. Next, he takes a plate from the kitchen counter and also puts it in the sink. He opens the fridge, finds and grabs a carrot, puts it back on the kitchen table, then finds and grabs a potato from the fridge, places it on the kitchen table, and finally switches off the kitchen light before walking back to the living room.
