The person is in the living room with a TV and a TV stand. The TV is on the stand, facing a computer, and the person is next to it. The TV is initially off but is switched on by the person using a remote control from the TV stand. The person then goes to the kitchen to grab a cupcake and later returns to the living room to eat it on the sofa, which is also facing the TV and computer. After eating, the person switches off the TV again. This process is repeated as the person also grabs juice and wine from the kitchen, drinking them while sitting on the sofa in the living room, before once more turning off the TV.
