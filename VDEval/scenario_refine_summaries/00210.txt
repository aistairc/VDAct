The person is in the bedroom and walks to the bathroom, where he switches on a light and wipes with a towel at the sink. He then grabs a toothbrush, uses it, and puts it down. Next, he takes a water glass and scrubs with it, shakes it, and puts it back. He grabs toothpaste, uses it, and places it on the sink. He picks up face cream, uses it, and puts it down. After wiping with the towel again, he walks to the kitchen, grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, and eats it. He then goes to the living room, approaches a sofa on a rug facing a TV, and eventually walks back to the sofa.
