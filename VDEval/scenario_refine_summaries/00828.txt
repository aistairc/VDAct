A person is in the kitchen, where he walks to the stove and wipes it with a washing sponge from the kitchen counter. Afterward, he moves to the living room, switches on the TV, retrieves the remote control, and sits on the sofa. He turns off the TV, switches it back on, then leaves the living room to grab a cupcake from the kitchen table. He returns to the sofa to eat the cupcake. When finished, he stands up, goes to the TV stand to put down the remote control, and switches off the TV again. He then goes back to the kitchen to grab a dish bowl from the kitchen counter and places it on the kitchen table. Next, he takes cereal from the kitchen counter, pours it into the dish bowl, and retrieves milk from the kitchen table to pour into the bowl as well.
