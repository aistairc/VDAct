The person moves between the bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room, interacting with various items in the kitchen. He finds juice, a water glass, a potato, milk, and cutlery (knife and fork), using the faucet to soak the potato and the glass to drink water. He places the potato in a frying pan, pours milk over it, and switches on and off the stove. He handles the cutlery, placing the knife and fork on the kitchen table and rug. Throughout the process, he remains primarily in the kitchen.
