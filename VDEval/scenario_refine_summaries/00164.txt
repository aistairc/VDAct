A person is in the kitchen where they find and grab milk, a cupcake, and alcohol. They walk to the living room, sit on the sofa, interact with the TV, and grab a remote control. After some movements between the kitchen and living room, they prepare food in the kitchen using a frying pan, slice of bread, and milk. The person then opens the fridge, retrieves alcohol and wine, and places the alcohol on the kitchen table.
