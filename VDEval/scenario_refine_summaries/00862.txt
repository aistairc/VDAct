The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where he walks to the sofa next to the TV and sits down. He drinks juice, stands up, and switches off the TV. After grabbing the remote control from the TV stand, he goes back to the kitchen to get milk, which he also brings to the living room, sits on the sofa again, and drinks. He then grabs his cellphone from the TV stand, texts, and returns to the kitchen to drink more milk.
