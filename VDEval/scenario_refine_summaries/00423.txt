A person moves through various rooms, starting in the bedroom and heading to the kitchen and living room. In the living room, they turn on the light switch. In the kitchen, they find a carrot on the kitchen table, grab it, soak it under the faucet, and then put it on the stove. After briefly turning the stove on and off, they grab wine from the kitchen table and put it in the fridge. They also retrieve a plate and place it on the sink, along with a cutlery fork and knife. Next, they grab a water glass and a wineglass, placing both on the sink as well. The person then heads to the bathroom to get a towel before returning to the kitchen, where they wipe with the towel. They grab the cutlery fork again, put it on the kitchen table, and then grab chocolate syrup, which they also put in the fridge before closing it.
