The person moves through the house, starting in the bathroom, then to the bedroom, kitchen, and living room. He finds and eats a cupcake in the living room, then interacts with a cat in the bedroom before returning to the kitchen. He grabs cereal and milk, switches the stove on and off, then heads back to the living room. He picks up a book from the bookshelf and sits on the sofa to read it.
