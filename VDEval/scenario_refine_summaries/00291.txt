The person is in the bathroom, where he walks to the toilet and then to the bar soap on the counter. He uses the soap, turns on and off the faucet, and then leaves for the living room. He then goes to the bedroom, sits on the bed, and turns off the light switch. He then interacts with a pile of clothes in the closet, folding them before returning to the kitchen. There, he grabs a water glass from the kitchen table, uses the sink and faucet, drinks the water, and puts the glass back down. The person then moves to the living room, where he sits on the sofa, interacts with a pillow, and eventually falls.
