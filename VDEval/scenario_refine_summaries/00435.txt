The person is in the kitchen and moves to the living room, where he interacts with the sofa and the TV. He then goes to the bedroom, sits on the bed, and texts on his cellphone. After returning to the kitchen, he grabs milk and a frying pan, pours the milk, and switches on the stove. He grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, puts it in the frying pan, and then grabs the chicken from the kitchen counter. After that, he walks to the sink and turns towards the garbage can, falling in the process. He then picks up a wineglass from the kitchen table and places it back on the table.
