The person moves through the bathroom to the kitchen, where he grabs juice from the table and drinks it. He then takes a water glass, turns on the faucet to fill it, drinks the water, and returns to the living room before going back to the kitchen. There, he grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, places it in a frying pan on the stove, turns on the stove, and pours milk from the counter into the frying pan. He switches off the stove and grabs a cutlery knife from the table, then puts it in the sink. The person then walks to the closed fridge, takes a washing sponge from the counter, wipes the fridge, and closes it before wiping again.
