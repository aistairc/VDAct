The person moves between the living room, kitchen, and bedroom. He sits on the bed in the bedroom, switches on the computer, types on the keyboard, and then transitions to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he grabs milk and a slice of bread, pours the milk, and switches on the stove. He also finds and takes juice from the fridge, placing it on the kitchen table before closing the fridge.
