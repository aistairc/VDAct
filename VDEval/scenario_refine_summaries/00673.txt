He walks to the stove, then to cereal and milk on the kitchen counter, grabs both, and pours them. He turns the stove on and off again. He then goes to the fridge, wipes it with a sponge, and closes it. After that, he grabs a frying pan from the stove and a chicken from the microwave, which is also in the kitchen. He walks to the sink and falls. The person then returns to the bedroom, moves back to the living room, where he interacts with the TV and remote control, eventually placing the remote on the coffee table before heading to the bathroom.
