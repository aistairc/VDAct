The person is in the bedroom and walks to the bathroom, where he switches off the light before using the toilet. After sitting and standing, he grabs bar soap from the bathroom counter, soaks and rinses it, then switches off the faucet. He grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste, brushes his teeth, and rinses the toothbrush before turning off the faucet again. The person then runs through the bedroom, kitchen, and living room, where he grabs a box from a wall shelf and sits on the sofa, falling while doing so.
