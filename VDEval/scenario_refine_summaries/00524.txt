The person is in the bedroom, then walks to the bathroom where he uses the toilet. He sits, stands, and then grabs bar soap from the counter, which is also in the bathroom. He switches on the faucet, soaks, and rinses the bar soap, then switches the faucet off. Next, he takes the toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter, brushes his teeth, and rinses the toothbrush before turning off the faucet again.
