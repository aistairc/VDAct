A person is in the kitchen, where they encounter a potato on the kitchen table. After grabbing the potato, they also pick up a salad, then go to a garbage can and place both items on it. The person then grabs crackers from the kitchen table, puts them in the fridge, and closes the fridge. They next take a wineglass from the table, place it on the kitchen table, and subsequently grab a plate from the kitchen counter. Finally, they walk to the sink and put the plate down, then pick up a cutlery fork from the kitchen counter and place it on the kitchen table.
