The person is in the living room, then walks to the kitchen where he interacts with the fridge, which is initially closed. After opening and closing it again, he falls. He returns to the kitchen, grabs a potato from the kitchen table, soaks it at the sink, and then places it in the microwave before turning it on and off. He then takes a plate from the counter, puts it on the sink, and grabs a washing sponge. Finally, he wipes the fridge with the washing sponge after opening it.
