A person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, where he finds milk on the kitchen counter and grabs it. He walks to the kitchen table, places the milk there, and also finds a water glass, which he drinks from multiple times. After switching off the kitchen light, he goes to the living room, interacts with a bookshelf, and falls twice. He returns to the kitchen, opens and closes the fridge, then goes back to the living room. The person again goes to the kitchen for the milk, grabs it, and encounters a frying pan on the stove. He pours the milk, turns on the stove, grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, and puts it on the frying pan before pouring more milk and switching off the stove.
