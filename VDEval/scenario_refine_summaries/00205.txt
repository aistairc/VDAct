The person is in the kitchen and interacts with various items. The milk is on the kitchen counter inside the kitchen, and he grabs it before going to the bathroom to get a towel, which he then brings back to the kitchen and places on the kitchen table. He opens the fridge, puts the milk inside, and turns off the light switch before walking to the living room and then back to the kitchen. He picks up the salmon from the counter, soaks it in the sink, and places it on a frying pan. After switching on the stove, he switches it off again.
