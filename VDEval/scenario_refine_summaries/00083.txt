The person moves from the bathroom to the bedroom, then to the kitchen, where he finds a light switch that is initially off. He turns it on, finds a wineglass on the TV stand, and pours wine into it at the sink. He also grabs a cutlery knife from the kitchen table. After placing the knives on the table, he turns the light switch off and walks to the living room. There, he approaches a bookshelf, grabs two books, and notices a cabinet nearby before he falls.
