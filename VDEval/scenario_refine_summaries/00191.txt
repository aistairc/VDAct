The person is in the kitchen and walks to the living room, where he sits on the sofa next to the TV. After interacting with a box in the bookshelf, he returns to the sofa, falls, and then goes back to the kitchen. There, he grabs a slice of bread from the toaster and uses a frying pan. He pours milk into the frying pan, turns the stove on and off, and retrieves juice and milk from the fridge. He places both on the kitchen table, switches off the light, and walks back to the living room.
