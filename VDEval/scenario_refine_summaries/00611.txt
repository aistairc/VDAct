A person goes from the bedroom to the kitchen, where they grab a water glass from the kitchen table and drink from it after turning on the faucet. They then clean the table with a washing sponge and pick up a cutlery fork to place on the kitchen table. The person also interacts with the fridge, opening and closing it after wiping it down with the sponge. They then move to the living room, switch on the TV, grab the remote control, turn off the TV, and place the remote back on the TV stand before walking to the bathroom.
