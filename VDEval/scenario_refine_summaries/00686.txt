A person is in the bathroom, where they grab a toothbrush from the counter, soak and rinse it at the faucet, then move to the living room. They turn on a light switch in the kitchen, turn it off, walk back to the living room where they interact with a TV and then grab a towel from the bathroom. The person wipes with the towel, turns the TV on using the remote control, and then goes back to the kitchen to grab a cupcake. They sit on a sofa in the living room, eat the cupcake, then put the remote control back on the TV stand and switch off the TV.
