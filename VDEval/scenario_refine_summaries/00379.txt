A person is in the kitchen where various items are located, including a fork, washing sponge, water glass, wine, chicken, and salmon. The fork is on the kitchen table, facing the clock and TV. The person grabs the fork and puts it on the rug. They then walk to the stove to use the washing sponge. They grab the water glass from the table, pour two glasses of water at the sink, and set them down. The person also grabs wine from the table and puts it down next to the first water glass. They then grab the chicken from the counter and the salmon from the microwave before walking to the garbage can to dispose of both.
