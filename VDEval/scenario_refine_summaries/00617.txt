The person is in the kitchen, where he interacts with a frying pan, a chicken, a sink, a kitchen table, a washing sponge, and a faucet. He grabs and wipes with the washing sponge, switches the faucet on and off, and then walks to the living room. In the living room, he sits on the sofa, switches on the TV, and retrieves the remote control. He then returns to the kitchen to grab some wine, brings it back to the living room, drinks it, and switches off the TV before placing the remote control on the TV stand.
