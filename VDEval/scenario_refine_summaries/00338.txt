The person is in the living room, then moves to the bedroom and kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds wine on the table and rug, grabs it, pours it into a wineglass, and drinks several times. He also interacts with a carrot on the kitchen counter, rinses it, and puts it in the fridge. The person then uses a washing sponge to clean the sink and stove, switching the faucet on and off in the process, while remaining in the kitchen throughout.
