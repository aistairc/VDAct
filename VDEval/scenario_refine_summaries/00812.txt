The person is in the kitchen and walks to the bedroom, where he goes to the closet and grabs pants and a shirt. He moves to the bed, places the pants and shirt on it, and then grabs a pile of clothes next to him, placing it on the bed as well. He folds the pants, the pile of clothes, and the shirt before putting them back in the closet. The person then goes to the bathroom, turns on the light switch, and runs through various rooms. Finally, in the living room, he grabs two books from a bookshelf and switches off the light before returning to the bedroom.
