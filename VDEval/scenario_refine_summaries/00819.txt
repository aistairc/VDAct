The person is in the bathroom, where he walks to the toilet and later to the bar soap on the counter. He switches on the faucet, soaks and rinses the bar soap, and then turns off the faucet. He moves to the bedroom, grabs the cat, and then heads to the living room. He sits on the sofa, retrieves the remote control, and then switches on the TV. After falling back, he goes to the kitchen, grabs a potato from the kitchen table, and soaks it at the sink. He then grabs a frying pan, places the potato in it, and retrieves milk from the counter. Finally, he pours the milk into the frying pan and switches on the stove before turning it off again.
