A person moves through the kitchen, interacting with various items. He starts by grabbing a carrot from the kitchen table and soaks it under the faucet. Next, he grabs a frying pan and places the soaked carrot on the stove, which he turns on and then off. The person also obtains a chicken and a salmon, which he places in the garbage can. He repeats grabbing the frying pan and chicken, then walks to a sink and falls near a bench. Afterward, he retrieves a washing sponge from the kitchen counter and wipes the stove. Finally, he returns to the kitchen table, grabs the washing sponge again, and wipes the table.
