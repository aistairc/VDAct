A person is in the kitchen, where they interact with a kitchen table and a washing sponge. They use the sponge to clean the stove before moving to the living room, where they operate a TV. The person then interacts with a remote control, sits on a sofa, and resumes using the TV. After switching the TV on and off, they go back to the kitchen to grab milk before returning to the living room to sit on the sofa and drink the milk. They return the remote control to the TV stand and prepare to sit again, before walking to a chair facing a computer but ultimately fall.
