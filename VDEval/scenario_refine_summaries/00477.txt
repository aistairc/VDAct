The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, where he finds salmon on the kitchen counter. He grabs the salmon, soaks it in the sink, and places it on a frying pan on the stove. After turning on and then off the stove, he retrieves crackers from the kitchen counter, puts them in the closed fridge, and then wipes the sink with a sponge. He switches off the light before returning to the living room, then back to the kitchen. He picks up a slice of bread from a toaster, places it on the frying pan, turns on the stove again, and finally pours milk from the kitchen table into the frying pan before switching off the stove.
