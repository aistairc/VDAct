The person is in the kitchen and moves to the living room, where he climbs onto a coffee table facing a computer and TV. He walks to the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, where he grabs a towel. After wiping with the towel in the living room, he returns to the kitchen to get a potato, soaks it at the sink, and then places it in a frying pan. He grabs milk and pours it into the frying pan while turning on the stove. The person then picks up a wineglass, places it on the kitchen table, and walks to the fridge. After wiping the fridge with a sponge, he opens and closes it again.
