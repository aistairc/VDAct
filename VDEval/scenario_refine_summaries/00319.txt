The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, retrieves a book from the desk, and reads it. He then grabs a piece of paper, sits in a chair, and writes on it. Afterward, he goes to the bedroom, grabs a cat, and returns to the living room to sit on a sofa. He accesses a remote control, turns on a TV, and then goes to a coffee table. Eventually, he walks to the bathroom, sits on the toilet, and returns to the bedroom and then back to the living room, straddling three times.
