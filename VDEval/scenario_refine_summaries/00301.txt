The person moves through the bedroom to the bathroom, uses the toilet, and then returns to the bedroom. He interacts with the bed and the light switch before falling while sitting on the bed. The cat is also in the bedroom, which he picks up and then returns to the bed. Next, he walks to the kitchen and then to the living room, where he sits on the sofa and interacts with the TV. He goes back to the bathroom to get a towel, then returns to the living room to wipe with the towel. He continues to move between the living room, kitchen, and bathroom, ultimately falling again in the kitchen.
