The person is in the living room where the TV is on the coffee table, and the coffee table is on the floor. The TV is OFF, facing the computer, which is also in the living room. The person walks to the TV, turns it ON, grabs the remote control from the same room, and then moves to the kitchen, where he interacts with a cupcake on the kitchen table and a slice of bread in the toaster. After eating both items, he returns to the living room, sits on the sofa, and eventually switches the TV OFF again. The person then walks around the room, interacting with the furniture, before heading to the bedroom and kitchen, where he falls.
