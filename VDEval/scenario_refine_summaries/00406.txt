A person is in the living room where the TV is on the stand, facing a computer. The TV is initially off, but the person turns it on using the remote control, which is also on the TV stand. After grabbing the remote, the person goes to the kitchen, where they find a cupcake on the kitchen table, grab it, and return to the living room to eat it on the sofa. The person then switches off the TV, goes back to the computer, sits in a chair, and types on the keyboard before turning off the computer. They return to the kitchen to grab a slice of bread from the toaster, eat it, and handle a plate on the kitchen table. After putting the plate down, they grab a sponge from the counter and clean the stove. Finally, the person walks to the bedroom, sits on a chair, and falls while sitting.
