The person moves through various rooms: starting in the bathroom, then walking to the bedroom and kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds a cupcake on the dishwasher and grabs it before heading to the living room to eat it. Afterward, he returns to the kitchen for wine, which he pours into a wineglass. He drinks the wine before grabbing a washing sponge to clean the sink, turning the faucet on and off in the process. He then goes back to the bedroom, finds a pillow, and sits on the bed before falling.
