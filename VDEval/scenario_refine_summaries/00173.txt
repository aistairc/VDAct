A person is in the living room where there is a box on a bookshelf. The person walks to the box, grabs it, and places it on a coffee table. He then climbs the coffee table, falls, and proceeds to the computer, sitting on a chair nearby to type. Afterward, he walks to the kitchen where he interacts with a TV and a towel in the bathroom. He wipes with the towel, then returns to the living room to turn on the TV. The remote control is grabbed from the TV stand and placed on the coffee table. The person then falls again before moving back to the kitchen to grab salmon and soak it at the sink. He puts the salmon on a frying pan and switches on the stove before switching it off again.
