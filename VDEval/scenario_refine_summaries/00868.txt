The person moves from the bathroom to the bedroom, then to the kitchen, where he finds and grabs a cupcake from the kitchen table, which is on the rug. The cupcake faces the TV and clock. He then walks to the living room, sits on the sofa, and eats the cupcake. Afterward, he returns to the kitchen, where he finds milk on the kitchen table and a frying pan on the stove. He pours the milk, turns the stove on, and grabs a slice of bread from the toaster, placing it on the frying pan. He then pours more milk and turns the stove off. 

Next, he grabs a water glass from the kitchen table and places two water glasses on the same table. He then grabs a washing sponge from the kitchen counter and wipes the kitchen table. After grabbing a water glass again, he walks to the sink, where he pours from both water glasses and puts them back.
