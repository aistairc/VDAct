A person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, retrieves a water glass from the kitchen table, and switches on the faucet to fill the glass. After drinking, he places the water glass on the kitchen counter and then goes to the bathroom to grab a towel. Returning to the kitchen, he wipes his hands with the towel before grabbing a cutlery fork from the kitchen table. He places two forks on the table, then grabs a washing sponge from the kitchen counter to clean the stove. Afterward, he walks to the living room, approaches the sofa, grabs a pillow, and sits down before standing up and falling.
