The person is in the living room, walks to the kitchen, and interacts with the fridge. After closing it, he returns to the living room, falls, and then grabs his cellphone. He moves to the bedroom, sits on the bed, texts, and returns to the living room to sit on the sofa. He then interacts with a box and climbs on the coffee table before falling again. He goes back to the kitchen to grab salmon, soaked in the sink and placed in a frying pan, but does not cook it. Finally, he returns to the living room to grab and read a book while sitting on the sofa.
