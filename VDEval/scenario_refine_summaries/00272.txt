The person is in the living room, where there is a bookshelf and a cabinet. He walks to the bookshelf, grabs two books, and then turns to the cabinet before falling. He also finds paper on the desk in the living room, grabs it, and faces the computer. The person then sits in a chair and writes on the paper before putting it back on the desk. He then walks to the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, where he sits on the toilet. The toothbrush is on the bathroom counter, which he grabs, and he turns on the faucet to soak and rinse the toothbrush before turning it off and returning to the living room, where he squats three times.
