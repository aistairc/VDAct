The person is in the kitchen, where he walks to the sink, grabbing a washing sponge from the counter. He wipes the sink before switching on and off the faucet. He then walks to the living room, retrieves a book from the desk, sits on the sofa, and reads. He turns on the TV, grabs the remote, and later returns to the kitchen to get alcohol from the table. After drinking on the sofa, he switches off the TV and goes back to the kitchen to grab salmon from the counter, soaks it in the sink, and puts it on a frying pan on the stove, which he then switches on and off. Finally, he grabs wine from the kitchen table and puts it back on the table.
