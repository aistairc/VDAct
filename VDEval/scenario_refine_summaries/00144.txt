The person is in the kitchen, where they grab a water glass from the kitchen table and walk to the sink to pour the water. They then head to the living room, where they switch on the TV and grab the remote control before sitting on the sofa. After standing again, they switch off the TV and repeat the process of turning it on and off. The person then returns to the kitchen to get juice and then milk, both of which they drink in the living room while sitting on the sofa. They continue to alternate between grabbing the remote control and managing the TV, ultimately putting the remote control on the TV stand and switching off the TV.
