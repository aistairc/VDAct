The person is in the bedroom and walks to the kitchen and then to the living room to turn on the light switch. He returns to the kitchen to find wine on the kitchen table, grabs it, and then gets a wineglass from the bookshelf. He pours wine into the glass and drinks multiple times. He puts the wineglass back, then goes to the fridge, finds and grabs a carrot, and places it on the kitchen table. He repeats this process with a potato, finds it in the fridge, grabs it, and closes the fridge.
