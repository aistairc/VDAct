The person moves through various rooms, first going from the bedroom to the kitchen and then to the living room. In the living room, he interacts with a wall picture frame and a TV. In the kitchen, he finds a potato on the kitchen table and rug, grabs it, and soaks it at the sink after turning on the faucet. He also uses a frying pan to prepare the potato and pours milk into it after grabbing the milk from the kitchen table. He then grabs a plate and puts it on the rug. The person cleans the sink with a washing sponge and uses the faucet while doing so. He then returns to the living room, retrieves a book from a bookshelf, reads it, and subsequently grabs a paper from the desk. Finally, he sits on a chair and writes on the paper.
