The person moves from the bedroom to the kitchen, then to the living room and the bathroom. Inside the bathroom, he sits on the toilet and then stands. He grabs bar soap from the counter, switches on the faucet to soak and rinse the soap, and then turns the faucet off. He then grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter, squeezes the toothpaste onto the toothbrush, brushes his teeth, rinses the toothbrush under the faucet, and switches it off again. Finally, he puts the toothbrush down and walks back to the living room, straddling three times.
