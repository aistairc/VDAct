A person is in the kitchen where a carrot is on the kitchen table. The person walks to the carrot, grabs it, and goes to the sink to rinse it. After that, they walk to the fridge, open it, put the carrot inside, and close it. The person then goes to the living room where they interact with a TV and a remote control, switching the TV on and off. They also drink juice from the kitchen while sitting on the sofa in the living room. The person then places the remote on the TV stand, switches off the TV, and walks to a bookshelf next to which a book is located. They grab the book, turn towards a chair nearby, and fall.
