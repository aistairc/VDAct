A person is in the kitchen and moves to the bedroom and living room, interacting with a TV and remote control. He switches the TV on and off and places the remote on a coffee table before returning to the bedroom. He turns off a light switch, sits on the bed, and then goes back to the kitchen, where he grabs juice and a water glass, pours the juice, and drinks both. The person handles a frying pan and chicken, then walks to the sink and fridge. He grabs a cutlery knife from the kitchen table and places it by the sink.
