The person is in the living room, where the TV is on the coffee table and facing the computer. The TV is initially off, but the person turns it on using the remote control, which is also in the living room. After grabbing the remote, the person goes to the kitchen to retrieve wine and then returns to the living room to drink it while sitting on the sofa. The person then puts the remote back on the coffee table and turns off the TV. 

Next, the person goes back to the kitchen, where they grab a potato, soak it at the sink, and then put it in a frying pan after grabbing milk. They pour the milk into the frying pan and turn on the stove but then switch it off again. 

The person returns to the living room, sits on the sofa again, and grabs two books from the nearby bookshelf before turning to the cabinet and falling.
