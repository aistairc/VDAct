The person is in the living room, where he interacts with a computer on a desk, sits in a chair, and types on a keyboard. He then walks to the kitchen, grabs a plate and a water glass from the kitchen counter, and obtains cutlery (a knife and a fork) from the counter drawer. He places the plate, water glass, knife, and fork on the kitchen table, along with a wineglass and wine. After completing these tasks, he returns to the living room, picks up a book, reads it, and writes on paper nearby. He also retrieves a box from the bookshelf and sits on a sofa, but falls while doing so. He then goes back to the kitchen, opens and closes the fridge, and returns to the living room, where he falls again.
