The person is in the kitchen, then walks to the bedroom where the book is located on the bookshelf. After interacting with the book, he goes to the desk, reads and grabs paper next to him. He sits on a chair facing the computer, switches it on, types, stands up, switches off the computer, and returns to the kitchen. There, he grabs and eats a slice of bread from the toaster, then walks to the sink to clean with a washing sponge. He interacts with the faucet, turning it on and off, and wipes again with the sponge. Finally, he walks to the living room and sits on the sofa.
