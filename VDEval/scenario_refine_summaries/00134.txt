A person is in the living room where the TV is located on a TV stand. The person switches the TV ON and uses the remote control, which is also in the living room. After grabbing the remote, the person goes to the kitchen, retrieves alcohol from the bookshelf, and brings it back to the living room to drink while sitting on the sofa. The person then switches the TV OFF. The person repeats a similar routine with wine: they walk to the kitchen, grab the wine, return to the living room to drink, and switch the TV OFF again. Later, the person moves to a chair facing a computer in the living room. They then walk to the kitchen, where they fall. After falling, they grab a cutlery knife from the kitchen counter and place it on a kitchen table. They also pick up a wineglass from the kitchen table and place it back on the table.
