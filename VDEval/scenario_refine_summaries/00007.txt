The person is in the living room where the TV is turned off on the TV stand. He switches on the TV and then grabs the remote control, walking to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he grabs wine from the kitchen table and sits on the sofa in the living room to drink it. Afterward, he finds the remote on the TV stand, puts it back, and switches off the TV. He goes back to the kitchen, grabs a potato, and soaks it under the faucet. He puts the potato in the microwave, which he then turns on, but switches off shortly after. Next, he grabs a salad from the kitchen counter, puts both the potato and the salad in the garbage can, and then grabs a water glass from the kitchen table. He also opens the fridge, finds alcohol inside, takes it, and places it on the kitchen table, finally retrieving wine from the fridge before closing it.
