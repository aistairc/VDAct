A person moves from the bathroom to the bedroom, where they turn off a light switch and sit on a bed. They grab pants from a closet, fold them, and place them on the bed. The person then returns to the bathroom, turns on the light, and proceeds to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they grab milk, drink it, and then get a water glass, fill it from a faucet, and drink from it. The person goes back to the bedroom, then the living room, and returns to the kitchen to grab the milk again. They pick up a frying pan, pour milk into it, and turn on the stove. They then get a slice of bread from the toaster, place it in the frying pan, pour more milk, and switch off the stove.
