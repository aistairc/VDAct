A person is in the kitchen, where they interact with a plate on the kitchen counter, grab it, and place it in the sink. Next, they grab a washing sponge from the counter and wipe the stove before moving to the living room, where they sit on the sofa and turn on the TV. The person then retrieves the remote control, switches the TV off, and returns to the kitchen to grab milk from the table. They go back to the living room, drink the milk, and reset the remote on the TV stand. The person returns to the kitchen again, grabs the milk, and encounters a frying pan on the stove. After pouring the milk and turning the stove on, they take a slice of bread from the toaster, place it in the frying pan, and then turn the stove off.
