The person moves from the kitchen to the living room, where he finds a book on the desk, grabs it, and reads. He then walks to a chair, sits, writes on a piece of paper that is next to him, and returns to the desk to put the paper down. After interacting with a computer, which he switches on and off, he sits on the sofa for a while before returning to the kitchen. There, he retrieves a dish bowl from a bookshelf, places it on the kitchen table, and then grabs cereal and milk from the counter, pouring them into the dish bowl. Afterward, he walks to the bedroom, interacts with the bed and a pillow, and eventually returns to the living room to turn on a light switch.
