A person is in the kitchen where he walks to the stove and grabs a washing sponge from the kitchen counter. He wipes the stove with the sponge, then moves to the kitchen table to grab a wineglass, which he pours twice at the sink. Next, he goes to the fridge, opens it, and wipes it with the sponge before closing it. He then grabs a cutlery fork from the kitchen counter, walks to the sink, and puts the fork down.
