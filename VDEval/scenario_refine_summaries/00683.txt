A person is in the living room, then walks to the kitchen where he finds milk on the kitchen counter. He grabs the milk, then walks to the frying pan on the stove, pours the milk, and switches on the stove. Next, he grabs a slice of bread from the toaster on the kitchen counter, puts it in the frying pan, and switches off the stove. He then walks to the fridge, wipes it with a washing sponge, and closes it. After returning to the living room and sitting on the sofa, he goes back to the kitchen to grab a carrot from the kitchen table, soaks it under the faucet, and places it on the stove. After turning the stove on and then off again, he grabs a cutlery knife from the kitchen table and puts two of them on the kitchen table.
