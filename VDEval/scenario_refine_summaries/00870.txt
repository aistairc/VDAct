A person is in the kitchen, where they interact with various items: a plate, a potato, a salad, cutlery forks, a washing sponge, and a water glass. The person grabs the plate and places it in the sink, then grabs the potato and later the salad. The potato and salad are placed on a garbage can. The person then grabs cutlery forks from the kitchen table, placing them back on the table. They also grab a washing sponge, wipe the stove, and then take and place water glasses on the kitchen table. Throughout, the person remains in the kitchen, moving between the items.
