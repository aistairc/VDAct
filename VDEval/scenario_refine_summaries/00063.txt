The person is in the living room, where there is a bookshelf on the floor. He walks to the bookshelf, grabs the first and second books, and then turns to the sofa before falling. After that, he goes to the kitchen, where he finds alcohol on the kitchen table. He grabs the alcohol and subsequently grabs a water glass, pouring alcohol into it and drinking from it multiple times. He wipes the kitchen table with a washing sponge he retrieves from the counter. Finally, he grabs a wineglass, walks to the sink, and pours two wineglasses.
