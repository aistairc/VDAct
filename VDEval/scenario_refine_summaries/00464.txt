The person is in the kitchen, where the fridge and kitchen table are located. He opens the fridge, finds and grabs a carrot, then puts it on the kitchen table. He does the same with a potato before closing the fridge. He then moves to the sink, puts a plate there, and walks to the living room. In the living room, he grabs a book, reads it, and gets a piece of paper from the desk. After sitting on a chair, he writes on the paper. 

Returning to the kitchen, he grabs the potato from the kitchen table, turns on the faucet, soaks the potato, and then uses a frying pan on the stove. He grabs milk from the table, pours it into the frying pan, and turns on the stove before switching it off. The person then grabs a chicken from the kitchen counter and walks to the sink, where he turns to the bench and falls.
