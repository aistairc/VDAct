The person is in the kitchen, where he interacts with the fridge and the washing sponge. He wipes the fridge twice and then transitions to the living room. There, he sits on the sofa before going back to the kitchen to grab a potato, soak it in the sink, and put it in the microwave. After using the microwave, he returns to the living room, where he watches TV and picks up the remote control, placing it on the coffee table. Finally, he turns towards the sofa and falls.
