A person is in the kitchen, where he walks to the sink and the washing sponge on the counter. He grabs the sponge, wipes the sink, and interacts with the faucet, turning it on and off. He then walks to the kitchen table, grabbing a plate, a water glass, a cutlery knife, and a fork, placing them on the table. He also grabs a wineglass and wine, putting those on the table as well. The person retrieves a cutlery knife twice and adds both to the kitchen table. Next, he walks to the fridge, opens it, and finds juice and milk, which he grabs before closing the fridge.
