A person is in the kitchen where they find a cutlery knife on the kitchen counter. They grab the knife and then walk to the sink, placing the knife there. The person then walks to the living room, finds a book on the desk, and sits on the sofa to read it. After some time, they return to the kitchen to find wine on the kitchen table, which they grab and put next to the wineglass. The person pours wine into the wineglass and drinks from it multiple times. They then check the closed fridge, open it, find a carrot and a potato inside, grab both, and place the carrot on the kitchen table before closing the fridge again.
