The person is in the kitchen, then walks to the bedroom where he finds a book in a bookshelf on the floor. He grabs the book and reads it at a desk, also located in the bedroom. Next, he retrieves notes from the bookshelf, writes on them while sitting on a chair on a rug, and then places them back on the desk. The person then goes to the bathroom, sits on the toilet, and grabs a toothbrush from the bathroom counter. He rinses the toothbrush under the faucet, puts it back, and returns to the bedroom to turn on a light switch. He grabs the book again, sits on the bed, and reads it. Finally, he goes back to the bathroom where he picks up a towel.
