The person is in the bathroom, then walks to the bedroom where he finds the light switch, which is ON. He turns it OFF and then proceeds to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he interacts with a wall picture frame, looks at it multiple times, and moves on to the chips on the kitchen table, grabbing them next. He walks to the fridge, opens it, puts the chips inside, and closes it. He then grabs a frying pan from the stove and then a chicken from the cutting board on the microwave. After that, he walks to the sink but falls. After recovering, he goes to the living room, where he switches the TV ON and then OFF using a remote control he retrieved from the coffee table, after which he places the remote back on the coffee table. Finally, he walks back to the bedroom and then to the bathroom.
