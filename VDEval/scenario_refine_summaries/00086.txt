The person moves through the bathroom, living room, kitchen, and bedroom. In the bedroom, he finds the light switch, turns it on, and grabs a book from the wall shelf. He sits on the bed and reads the book. He then returns to the kitchen and bathroom, closing the bathroom door and turning on the bathroom light. He grabs a toothbrush and toothpaste from the bathroom counter, brushes his teeth using the faucet, and then turns off the faucet. Finally, he returns to the kitchen to grab and eat a slice of bread from the toaster.
