A person is in the living room with a TV that is off. He walks to the TV, switches it on, then retrieves the remote control before heading to the kitchen. In the kitchen, he finds and grabs a cupcake from the kitchen table, sits on the sofa in the living room, eats the cupcake, and switches off the TV. He returns to the kitchen to grab a potato and soaks it under the faucet before putting it in a frying pan. He then pours milk into the frying pan, turns on the stove and immediately turns it off. The person opens the fridge, takes a carrot, places it on the kitchen table, goes back to the fridge for the potato, and then closes the fridge. Next, he grabs a wineglass and places it on the kitchen table, followed by a water glass, which he pours, and then puts the water glass down.
