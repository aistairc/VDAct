The person starts in the bathroom, walks to the bedroom, and switches off the light. He sits on the bed then heads to the kitchen to grab milk from the counter and puts it on the kitchen table. He also grabs a water glass, pours milk into it, and drinks from both the water glass and the milk. After that, he grabs a washing sponge from the counter, wipes the sink, and turns the faucet on and off. Finally, he walks to the living room, picks up a book from the bookshelf, sits on the sofa, and reads the book.
