The person is in the living room, where the TV is located on a TV stand. The TV is initially off. The person walks to the TV, switches it on, and then retrieves the remote control, also in the living room. After grabbing the remote, he goes to the kitchen, where he finds a slice of bread in the toaster. He takes the bread and returns to the living room, sits on the sofa, and eats the slice. He then stands, places the remote back on the TV stand, switches off the TV, and grabs his cellphone, also in the living room. After sitting back on the sofa and texting, he stands up and goes to the kitchen again, where he drinks milk from the kitchen table and then grabs a water glass. He pours the water at the sink, puts the glass down, and switches off the light before walking back to the living room.
