A person is in the kitchen where they interact with various items. They grab a carrot from the kitchen table, wash it at the sink, and then put it inside the fridge. The person then takes a plate and a water glass from the table and places them back on the table. They also grab a cutlery knife and fork from the kitchen counter, placing them on the kitchen table as well. The person then interacts with a wineglass and a bottle of wine, placing them on the kitchen table. They find juice and milk in the fridge, taking both and placing them on the kitchen table. Finally, the person switches off the light and leaves for the living room, before returning to the kitchen to repeat some actions with the carrot, soaking it at the sink, then placing it on a frying pan on the stove, which they turn on and off.
