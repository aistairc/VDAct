The person is in the living room and walks to the computer, which is next to him. He turns on the computer, sits on a chair facing it, types on the keyboard, then stands and turns off the computer. He moves to the kitchen, where he grabs a slice of bread from the toaster and eats it. He then grabs a water glass from the kitchen table, walks to the sink, and pours two glasses of water. Afterward, he returns to the living room, approaches the sofa, grabs a pillow, sits down, stands up, and falls.
