The person is in the living room, where a computer is on a desk. He walks to the computer, turns it on, sits on a chair next to it, and types on the keyboard. After standing up, he goes to the kitchen, where he grabs a frying pan and chicken from the counter. He then walks to the sink and turns toward a bench, falling in the process. The person finds and opens the fridge to retrieve juice and milk, placing both on the kitchen table before going back to the living room. There, he sits on the sofa, switches on the TV, grabs the remote control, and later returns to the kitchen to get wine. After returning to the sofa, he drinks the wine, stands up, puts the remote on the TV stand, and switches off the TV.
