The person is in the living room, where they interact with a sofa on a rug, facing a TV on a stand. They move to the kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom, where they grab a towel from the bathroom counter. The person returns to the living room, grabs a pillow from the sofa, and scrubs with the towel while shaking and placing the pillow down. They then move back and forth between the kitchen, bedroom, and living room, eventually sitting on the bed in the bedroom and interacting with the light switch. Finally, they return to the living room and straddle three times.
