A person is in the kitchen where they interact with various items, including a cutlery knife, plate, cutlery fork, wine, and a glass of water. They manipulate these items by walking to them, grabbing them, and placing them on the sink or kitchen table. The person then opens the fridge to put the wine inside before continuing to move back and forth between the kitchen and the bathroom, where they grab a towel. They eventually return to the kitchen to wipe something with the towel. The person then moves to the bedroom, interacts with a pillow, and sits on the bed before standing up and falling.
