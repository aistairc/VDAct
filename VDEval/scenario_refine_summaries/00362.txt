The person moves from the living room to the kitchen, retrieves alcohol from a bookshelf, and places it on the kitchen table. He then grabs a water glass, walks between the two items, pours the alcohol, and consumes both the alcohol and water. After returning to the living room, he sits on the sofa, uses a computer, types on a keyboard, and then switches off the computer. He goes back to the kitchen, takes a slice of bread from the toaster, eats it, and then grabs a cutlery fork before placing it in the sink.
