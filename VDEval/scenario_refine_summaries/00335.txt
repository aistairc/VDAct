The person is in the living room, where there is a sofa, computer, TV, and a desk. He sits on the sofa, then gets up and walks to the TV, then to the kitchen, where he falls. After returning to the living room, he grabs a book from a wall shelf, sits on the sofa again, and reads the book. He also interacts with a towel in the bathroom, returning to the living room with it. He grabs a mouse and a keyboard from the desk, performs wiping actions with the towel, and sits on the sofa again. The pillow is also in the living room; he picks it up and shakes it. Finally, he turns off the light switch before walking to the kitchen and then to the bedroom.
