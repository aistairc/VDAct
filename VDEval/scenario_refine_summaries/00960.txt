The person is in the bathroom and walks to the bedroom where he finds the light switch and turns it OFF. He then sits on the bed, which is on the rug, and grabs his pants from the closet. He folds the pants and places them on the bed before heading back to the bathroom. In the bathroom, he retrieves the toothbrush and toothpaste from the counter, brushes his teeth after turning on the faucet, rinses the toothbrush, and turns off the faucet. Finally, he walks back to the bedroom and then to the living room, where he stretches three times.
